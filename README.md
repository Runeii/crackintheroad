# Crack in the Road
This project is designed to be a long standing archive of UK music blog Crack in the Road, living on as a snapshot of UK youth culture in the 2010s.

All content is hosted within this repo, there are no longer any external dependencies.

## Notes
Small fixes that could be tackled one day:

- [ ] Categories load all data immediately, though do not render as elements.
- [ ] Add notice that shows last time snapshot shuffled
- [ ] Hit Netlify webhook once per week
