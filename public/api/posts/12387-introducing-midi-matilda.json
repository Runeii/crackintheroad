Grand choruses, addictive hooks and echoed vocals galore, their two debut tracks are perfect for that Sunday morning comedown. Shuffling in somewhere between<strong> MGMT</strong> and <strong>Washed Out</strong>, the reverb heavy <em>Day Dreams</em> is a startlingly confident first foray into the scene. On the other hand, <em>Red Light District</em> is a more melancholic affair, reminiscing about a mysterious lady of the night and our all-to-human urges.
