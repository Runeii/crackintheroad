Ward (<em>Seashell</em>) covers. The closing track to the release, <em>Playing Along</em>, is a beautiful six minute journey, through various dreamstates, relying at differing times on Davis’s vocals and their combined production skills. The likes of <em>Seashell</em> pay homage to the qualities of the originals, without ripping them off, taking them into modern, more atmospheric territories, whilst adding their own <strong>MAIDS</strong> stamp of approval. With these five tracks, <strong>MAIDS</strong> not only mark their authority as one of the most exciting new acts to emerge this year, but also truly build anticipation for future releases.</p>\n<p>Check out the <em><strong>Maid Up</strong></em> EP below, and purchase one of the beautiful CDs from their bandcamp and pick me up a t-shirt while you’re at it.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 693px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1127914803/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/package=4016339962/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23693-introducing-maids","category":"introducing","date":1375731228000,"wpid":23693,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":633,"src":"2013/08/998363_563461563718628_1281131403_n-950x633.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEF/8QAHRABAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMRAAIFMRIikf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACABED/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDQ43mdPCOJgDQ9VO0Rt+1kl0GTdEq2u8Yw5GefZHMv/9k="},"createdAt":1587283141267,"updatedAt":1588443768074,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/998363_563461563718628_1281131403_n-950x633.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
