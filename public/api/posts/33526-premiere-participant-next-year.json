{"id":"5e9bf8078fb2d30d7769c8e5","title":"Premiere: Participant – Next Year","content":"<p>Lifted from a recently released cassette, this latest track from Dublin’s <strong>Participant</strong> (Stephen Tiernan) is devastatingly honest.</p><p> Next Year finds Tiernan tearing himself apart with self-doubt, with an openness often associated with the likes of Keaton Henson or Elliott Smith, starting out intimately and building to a blossoming, gorgeously layered chorus of sorts.

Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/309052283&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33526-premiere-participant-next-year","category":"music","date":1492515716000,"wpid":33526,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1999,"height":1185,"src":"2017/04/avatars-000290436756-ml6216-original.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAQMEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwECBAAFEiEHEUFx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALLk+HbBclWmXNJNLLkDCAQumOEJHFwyaq7aulXW+/a1l5FyX7SlB//Z"},"createdAt":1587279879115,"updatedAt":1588403501169,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/04/avatars-000290436756-ml6216-original.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
