Troubadour in his style (his website/blog details his travels and gigs around Bali), <strong>Matthew P</strong>‘s tracks capture a level of intimacy while remaining endearingly relaxed. While there are flares of folk influences, <strong>Matthew </strong>has managed to create his own distinct sound that compliments his dulcet tones and absorbing lyrics. ‘<strong>The Breakfast Song</strong>‘ captures many of <strong>Matthew</strong>‘s finest musical qualities and provides an ideal soundtrack for those lazy summer mornings that extend until you summon the energy to venture to the nearest Beer Garden.</p>\n<p>Comparisons will inevitably be made with <strong>Johnny Flynn</strong>, however <strong>Matthew P </strong>brings something completely different to the table with his delightful folky musings.</p>\n<p><strong>Crack In The Road </strong>can also announce we will be recording an <strong>Exclusive Unplugged Session </strong>with <strong>Matthew P </strong>next month! However in the mean time, you can download his latest track, ‘<strong>The Breakfast Song</strong>‘, for free below!</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11141971&show_comments=true&color=1d6327\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11141971&show_comments=true&color=1d6327\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object><span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/matthewpmusic/matthew-p-the-breakfast-song\">Matthew P – The Breakfast Song</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/matthewpmusic\">matthewpmusic</a></span></p>\n","slug":"5666-mpfree-news-matthew-p-the-breakfast-song","category":"music","date":1300847535000,"wpid":5666,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294610573,"updatedAt":1588441789833,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2011/03/matthew-p-188x188.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
