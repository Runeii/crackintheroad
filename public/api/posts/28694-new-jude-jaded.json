Making an explosive introduction with the stunning Crystals, which clocked up a colossal amount of online love, the two-piece have returned with their second offering, <em>Jaded</em>, lifted from an EP expected later in the year. Again finding the killer relationship between Neal’s seamless production and Morris’s tantalising vocals, it’s the simultaneously the sound of now, and very much the sound of the future.</p>\n","slug":"28694-new-jude-jaded","category":"music","date":1401900983000,"wpid":28694,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282104252,"updatedAt":1587825848042,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","new"]}
