The films aesthetic, as usual with a Fincher film, is hugely dark and brooding, but also effortlessly cool. Every time that man releases a film he builds on these effects. This time around,<strong> Trent Reznor</strong> and<strong> Atticus Ross</strong> have created some exceptional music – and a lot of it.</p>\n<p>According to <strong>Reznor</strong>, the soundtrack will be released on several different digital formats, a special edition 3xCD digipak, and a ridiculous limited-to-3000 edition signed 6xLP in a metal sleeve with a poster and an 8GB razor blade USB pen. Now I know Fincher/<strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> collectors will go crazy, but <strong>Reznor</strong> being <strong>Reznor</strong>, he wouldn’t be himself if he didn’t give some music away for free. Which is great, ’cause that’s exactly what he’s done.</p>\n<p>Below you can grab on a 6-track sampler of full tracks from the forthcoming OST for the film. And they’re beautifully created tracks. If you’ve heard much of the releases <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> and <strong>How To Destroy Angels</strong> have put out recently you’ll know what kind of scale <strong>Reznor</strong> often aims for, and if you liked the soundtrack for <em>The Social Network</em>, you’re going to effing love this. I don’t really want to spoil it for any of you by analysing the tracks – they just need to be heard.</p>\n<p>Also released is the track (debuted in the film’s teaser trailers) <strong>Trent Reznor</strong> and <strong>Atticus Ross</strong> did with <strong>Karen O</strong> of <strong>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong> – possibly going down in history as one of the best covers of all time. <em>Immigrant Song</em> by <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong>. And if you haven’t heard it, you’re crazy. Building on the original with industrial brutality, the cover isn’t so much of a cover as an agressive, postmodernist update – it’s relentlessly serious as much as it’s in-your-face. Fincher has also asked the pair’s band <strong>How To Destroy Angels</strong> (the band completed by Reznor’s wife, <strong>Mariqueen Maandig</strong>) to cover a tune by <strong>Bryan Ferry</strong> (of <strong>Roxy Music</strong> fame) – <em>Is Your Love Strong Enough?</em> – but that cover is yet to be revealed.</p>\n<p>Back to the point at hand – most importantly, I urge you to listen to the <strong>Led Zep</strong> cover, and download the soundtrack sampler. I don’t know what the film will be like – my personal favourite Fincher films being <em>Zodiac</em> and <em>Se7en</em> – but it will be grisly, that’s for sure. And beautifully shot and edited, naturally. Listen to the music too though.</p>\n<p><em>Enter your email address to download the 6-track sample for The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo soundtrack below.
