(There is a little pill placed between the pages of an open book. The shape of the pill corresponds to the shapes on both patterned pages.) There’s lot of references to nature too; trees, bits of mountains.</strong></p>\n<p>DL:  Nature is an obvious starting point. It’s there to begin with, something to look at.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;\"><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-01-29-at-12.19.47-PM.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-27342 aligncenter\" title=\"Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place, Aerial view\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-01-29-at-12.19.47-PM-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot 2014-01-29 at 12.19.47 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></span></p>\n<dl id=\"attachment_27342\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 510px;\">\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place, Aerial view</dd>\n</dl>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JW: So you’re more concerned with how to look at something?  Or is the starting point of nature also important?</strong></p>\n<p>DL: I’ve been looking at having the camera really close to something but having your body really far away from it.</p>\n<p><strong>JW:<br />\nNature as a subject matter suggests that what you’re interested in is changeable and interconnected. Like the weather in one part of the world, there is an immeasurable effect with the corresponding weather in a completely opposite corner of the earth.<br />\n</strong><strong>So you’re talking about seeing two opposite perspectives of the same thing at once?</strong></p>\n<p>DL: There are different images, the image you see and an image which is inside of you that corresponds to the image seen.</p>\n<p><strong>JW: Someone else could be looking at the same image as you but seeing a different internal image.</strong></p>\n<p>DL:  It’s that gap</p>\n<p><strong>JW: It’s a performance.</strong></p>\n<p>DL: Yes, I started writing a script between a sleepwalker and an insomniac. I was thinking about the miscommunication in dialogue that could happen. I think I write in a very visual way. The narrative is driven visually.</p>\n<p><strong>JW: So they’re both communicating with each other about the same experience but they’re experiencing it differently. It’s the mediation.</strong></p>\n<p>DL: Mediation is a really interesting term; there’s a matter of media as in a mathematical sense, being a middle point. A meeting point of two distinct trajectories maybe.</p>\n<p><strong>JW: An investigation; with you as the investigator. You put images of the same things into different mediums. What we see is a sculpture, a digital rendition created through software and a screen-print of the same image, altogether.</strong></p>\n<p>DL: That’s right, it’s in a way using a ‘Google Glass,’ constantly unfolding information from one image, one sight. A supernatural ability to be omniscient and singular at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>JW: You’re making space.</strong></p>\n<p>DL:  If the space we’re talking about here is definitely about proximity than distance, yes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_27232\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/IMG_9631_2-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-27232\" class=\" wp-image-27232       \" title=\"Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/IMG_9631_2-1-260x173.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9631_2-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-27232\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_27340\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-01-29-at-12.16.17-PM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-27340\" class=\" wp-image-27340    \" title=\"Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place, Aerial View\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-01-29-at-12.16.17-PM-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot 2014-01-29 at 12.16.17 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-27340\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place, Aerial View</p></div>\n<p><strong> JW: I forgot to ask simply: ‘What it is you’re looking at?’</strong></p>\n<p>DL: That’s ironically the hardest question for me. I’d rather say I see nothing, but plenty to look at!<br />\nI went to a talk about Wim Wenders’ and philosopher’s Mary Zournazi’s new book (<i>Inventing Peace, a Dialogue on Perception) </i>Wim Winder’s said that ‘looking is different to seeing.’ He spoke about the relationship between the camera, audience and actors in the work of Japanese director Ozu. Winders’ described Ozu’s films as ‘cinema that is tender and compassionate.’</p>\n<p><strong>JW: It’s funny that you say that.  (We both sort of mock-swoon) That’s giving feelings, human emotions, to mechanistic processes.</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_27234\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/DounaLim2_-copy.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-27234\" class=\" wp-image-27234  \" title=\"Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/DounaLim2_-copy-260x173.jpg\" alt=\"DounaLim2_ copy\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-27234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 22px;\"> </span></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_27343\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-01-29-at-12.16.11-PM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-27343\" class=\" wp-image-27343      \" title=\"Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place, Aerial View\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-01-29-at-12.16.11-PM-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot 2014-01-29 at 12.16.11 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-27343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Douna Lim, 3 Perspectives, 1 Place, Aerial View</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JW: I can’t help thinking about alchemy.</strong></p>\n<p>DL: The intellectual concept of alchemy is the search for a ‘pure material.’</p>\n<p><strong>JW: Perhaps synthetic.</strong></p>\n<p>DL: I want to talk about a process that relates to alchemy, without any of the mysticism attached to it.</p>\n<p><strong>JW: The image of mysticism is already attached to it.  An alchemist is an investigator though, of materials. Perhaps it’s your desire to approach your work with the qualities of an investigator or maybe, to use your art as a tool for investigation.</strong></p>\n<p><i></i>DL: For me, alchemy it is a way of describing a creative process:</p>\n<p>1 element internal to me   + 1 element external to me  = something else.</p>\n<p>JW:  We can’t avoid talking about Carl Jung.</p>\n<p>DL: For Jung, there are three derisions on what alchemy reaches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pure material</li>\n<li>Primary material</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And more figuratively,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gold!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’m most interested in the idea of a primary material.</p>\n<p><strong>JW: A material yet to be transformed.
