First case in point, the presentation of his record, a bafflingly dark 35-minute video piece that arrogantly poses more questions than it answers.  More than anything, what’s remarkable is the now (vaguely) infamous mystery surrounding the man’s identity itself; no one has any idea who he is. Sure, we’ve seen/heard/been bored by this all before, but once you include that the names that are being banded about more than any are <strong>Flying Lotus</strong> himself and the annoyingly omnipresent <strong>Tyler the Creator</strong>, and you’ve rather unwittingly stumbled onto the most tantalising of mysteries.</p>\n<p>For the record, i’m CONVINCED it’s <strong>Flylo.</strong></p>\n<p>I’ll assume by this point you’re <em>slightly </em>interested, so click <strong><a href=\"https://www.captainmurphy.xxx/\">HERE</a></strong> to stream his debut mixtape and after check out his earlier work with EARL and FlyLo <strong><a title=\"New: Flying Lotus – Between Friends (Feat.
