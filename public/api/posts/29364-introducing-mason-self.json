Listening through to the record, it’s an at times disjointed listen, swinging from the wonderfully understated <em>(Niner</em>) to gloriously over the top (<em>Rend</em>). Perhaps more experimental than the vast majority of music that ends up on CitR, I can’t help but draw comparisons to <strong>Battles</strong>, in the off-kilter percussion (<strong>Alt-J</strong> anyone?) and sheer beautiful calamity of the tracks.
