After even more digging I also discovered that <strong>MONEY</strong> are managed by Max Moran, who looks after <strong>Egyptian Hip Hop</strong> and <strong>Vondelpark</strong>. Those tit-bits were only found by trawling their <a href=\"https://courtesyisafallacy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a> which features niche videos and quotes, and a handful of Youtube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/jamesjlee12\" target=\"_blank\">videos</a>. The most recent of said videos, was uploaded last Friday, for the majestic track <em>The Sea</em>. Composed almost entirely of a sombre piano and strained vocals, it’s a truly beautiful track, coming in somewhere between <strong>WU LYF</strong> and <strong>Arcade Fire</strong>. The video is comprised of grainy, black and white war footage, elegantly mirroring the atmosphere of <em>The Sea</em>. Check out the track and video below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqTMGy18Co8\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p>‘Each tear: a row of stars,<br />\nEach pain: a sun.<br />\nA Sun that tightens air<br />\nAnd a light that knows not light itself,<br />\nThat knows but mass,<br />\nAnd by total force<br />\nDoes eat up the heavens<br />\nTo fill its maddening sight.<br />\nA dainty sum!<br />\nMade of mind-sacks that never die,<br />\nOf Suns that are always weeping.’</p>\n","slug":"12038-introducing-money","category":"introducing","date":1319491439000,"wpid":12038,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293636997,"updatedAt":1587825912865,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","new","music","videos"]}
