Set for UK release on 26 August, the quirky collective are unveiling a blog-orientated schedule for premiering tracks, and we’re delighted to have the exclusive stream of <em>They Were Wrong</em>, our personal highlight from the album. Whilst playing to their folk roots, there’s an emotional instability to <strong>ESatMZ</strong> that’s surprisingly refreshing. Check out <em>They Were Wrong</em> below, and keep your eyes peeled for further tracks from the LP, ahead of the full stream and release on the 26th.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F105552745%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-zgNft\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23919-uk-premiere-edward-sharpe-and-the-magnetic-zeros-they-were-wrong","category":"music","date":1376840885000,"wpid":23919,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283062767,"updatedAt":1588441763328,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/esmz-01-hi-credit-laure-vincent-bouleau-950x633.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
