And never have I heard such a grateful Christmas-themed cover in respect for the original(s) since…<strong>Weezer</strong>‘s <em>Christmas with Weezer</em>? Admittedly, <strong>Mayer Hawthorne</strong> did cover this same track last Christmas (using the original instrumental), but this new one really does take the (Christmas) biscuit…</p>\n<p>Okay I’ll stop.
