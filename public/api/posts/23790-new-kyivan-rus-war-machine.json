Maloney & Luke Waites)</strong> are not quite the finished article just yet, but their newest track, <em>War Machine</em>, certainly shows development and an abundance of potential. It does has hints of, as they describe, a ‘post-apocalyptic’ atmosphere, hidden away amongst the drone influenced synths. In truth, much of the beauty lies amidst the combination of the vocal and string sections, that echo the likes of Manchester’s <strong>MONEY</strong>. Whilst the production falls slightly flat at times, particularly on the vocal, there’s more than enough here to suggest that <strong>Kyivan Rus</strong> have an extremely bright future ahead of them.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104897421\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23790-new-kyivan-rus-war-machine","category":"mpfree","date":1376342009000,"wpid":23790,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":123,"src":"2013/08/555072_563582820332856_1869859100_n-165x123.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAURBAYHEhUxQf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQRMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AyTi/krT7N25fbbqrW1x8mQrd5QqxIFIygwSWyRn5gVEzXaKSZ3ERAZiQM+qUolA3ZQmTYg0DP//Z"},"createdAt":1587283103201,"updatedAt":1588443767716,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/555072_563582820332856_1869859100_n-165x123.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
