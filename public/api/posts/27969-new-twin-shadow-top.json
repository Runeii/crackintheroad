This time he’s back with the anthemic <em>To The Top, </em>which could be as close to an ’80s power ballad as you’ll get this year.</p>\n<p><em>To The Top </em>is a free download, so jump on that. Word is, he’s also currently spending time in the studio working on the follow up to <strong><em>Confess</em></strong>. It’s time to get excited.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/144667558&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>(via <a title=\"Pitchfork - Twin Shadow Share \"To the Top\"\" href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/54779-twin-shadow-share-to-the-top/\" target=\"_blank\">Pitchfork</a>)</p>\n","slug":"27969-new-twin-shadow-top","category":"music","date":1398085071000,"wpid":27969,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282196320,"updatedAt":1587825849934,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d23","categories":["music","new"]}
