Homerun for a new side of dubstep here.</p>\n<p>Exciting things to come for Erik Hassle in 2014. I’m quite sure of it.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/124504427″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"25528-premiere-erik-hassle-talk-deebs-remix","category":"music","date":1387202416000,"wpid":25528,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":640,"height":894,"src":"2013/12/erikhassle_lorez-640x894.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAOAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgQI/8QAKRAAAQMDAgILAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEQchBjEIEhMjM0FCUWFxwf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAloZqDN4VsN/bgtJkKYLctYCCQWQQHDnlkA7DYnJOdsUrkdICGqQ6oMzMFRPhp9/us72S+TbXGnR4bpbZnM9g+kepP4eYz8moFOt9Y93jfyoP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282648947,"updatedAt":1588403523180,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"2013/12/erikhassle_lorez-640x894.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
