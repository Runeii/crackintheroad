New track <em>Bloodlust</em> features their signature harmonised guitar sound as well as the soaring vocals of frontwoman Izzy Bee that glide over the noughties styled production. This track marks the announcement of their debut E.P which will be released via Duly Noted Records. The exclusively physical release will only be available at gigs, which serves as even more of a reason to catch <strong>Black Honey</strong> live.
