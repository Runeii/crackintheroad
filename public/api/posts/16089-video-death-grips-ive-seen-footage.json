Are they saying something? Nothing? Lots of things? Ironically, they have had plenty of catchy moments, but this has a particular electronic energy driving it, and this video accentuates their maniacal nature.</p>\n<p>It’s certainly an impressive piece of editing, considering the amount of original footage probably filmed or sourced, but Zack & co. definitely aren’t shy in terms of the visual aspects of the project. If you thought their .GIF experimentation was as far as they could go, watch the video below – just another weapon in the <strong>Death Grips</strong> arsenal, and again, at least pretty imaginative. Very excited for the album (by the way the first of two this year) – <em>The Money Store</em> is out on Monday!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><center><object width=\"640\" height=\"360\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/sticXkHxZC4?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"640\" height=\"360\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/sticXkHxZC4?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object></center></p>\n","slug":"16089-video-death-grips-ive-seen-footage","category":"music","date":1334778420000,"wpid":16089,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292542764,"updatedAt":1588441778976,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/death-grips-5356bc62360ca.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
