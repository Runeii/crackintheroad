We seemed to miss covering <em>Oh Come On </em>when it was released a couple of months back, so we’re not missing new single <em>Ha Ha Ha. </em></p>\n<p>Fans of her earlier work won’t find any huge surprises here, but I don’t mean that in a bad way. This is scuzzy, energetic garage rock with Hanna’s trademark hyperactive half-sung, half-screamed vocals making it impossible to not play it at full volume.</p>\n<p>Give it a spin below alongside personal favourite <em>A Place Called Won’t Be There; </em>a scruffier, rawer cut from the original Julie Ruin album back in 1998, breakbeat percussion, minimal guitar and all.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p>Their album <em>Run Fast </em>is out 3rd September via TJR Records.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/102450312″ params=”” width=” 100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/102559335″ params=”” width=” 100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"23751-new-the-julie-ruin-ha-ha-ha","category":"new","date":1376048659000,"wpid":23751,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283120474,"updatedAt":1588441763512,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2013/08/tumblr_mgogibezam1qhi7aro1_1280-165x109.jpg","categories":["new"]}
