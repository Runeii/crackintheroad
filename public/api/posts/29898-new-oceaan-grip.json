With his first live shows just around the corner, and the promise of more material on the way, it’s set to be an exciting end to 2014 for Oceaán. Check out Grip below, alongside European live dates.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/168303355&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>October 1st</b>  Elektricity Festival, Reims, France</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>October 2nd</b>  Peniche, Lille, France</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>October 4th</b>  Marché Gare, Lyon, France</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>October 7th</b>  Laiterie, Strasbourg, France</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>October 18th</b>  Sound of Copenhagen @ DR Koncerthuset, Copenhagen, Denmark</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>November 1st</b>  Ideal Bar, Vega, Copenhagen, Denmark</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>November 11th </b> Les InRocks Festival, Casino de Paris, Paris, France [w / Lykke Li and Woman’s Hour]</p>\n","slug":"29898-new-oceaan-grip","category":"music","date":1411146346000,"wpid":29898,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281875012,"updatedAt":1588441754235,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/91169cc833f3573723b64bb12492eff78aab166c.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
