The new video for ‘<em>Sometimes happy, sometimes sad</em>‘ is an appropriate if not expected visual interpretation of the track. Rapid fire textured visuals, with a surrealist escapade tale at the videos core; I can get on board.</p>\n<p>Pitchfork also dropped a new track from the release yesterday, to which I’m struggling to find code.
