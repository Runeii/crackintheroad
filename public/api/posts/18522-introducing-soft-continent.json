However in ‘Scars’, Soft Continent have produced a track that immediately instills a sense of intrigue into the listener, evolving into a sultry, intimate experience that is guided by the softened, warming vocals of Jess Jones. There is a classic sense of drama within ‘Scars’ that draws influences from the musical tradition of the band’s location, while making sure to balance this carefully with a modern ear in mind.</p>\n<p>As is the case with most of the bands we feature here on Crack In The Road, this is a very promising first step that should be appreciated as such. If the next release from Soft Continent manages to galvanize and develop the essence of ‘Scars’, then expect to see them around these digital parts again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"18522-introducing-soft-continent","category":"introducing","date":1354266047000,"wpid":18522,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284432148,"updatedAt":1588441773379,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2012/11/soft-continent-950x950.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
