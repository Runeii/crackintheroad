{"id":"5e9c09c7774c2610387e5181","artists":["5e9b69317a1236eccfeb2443"],"title":"Festival Preview: Pleasure Principle","content":"<p>Anyone that attended <a title=\"Preview: BLOC 2012\" href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/17145-preview-bloc-2012/\">Bloc 2012</a> earlier this year saw the death of 2 important things; the death of the UK’s flagship electronic music festival and the demise of the ‘location based music festival’. Once the anger had subsided, all we were left with was a grand sense of loss. This empty space was always going to be filled, but the questions of ‘how’ and ‘when’ were pressing ones.</p>\n<p>Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the Glasgow-based <a href=\"https://nmbrs.net/\">Numbers</a> label, and the label will be teaming up with Dedbeat Festival to launch <a href=\"https://pleasureprinciple.net/\">Pleasure Principle</a>, a project that by the looks of things will pick up exactly where <strong>Bloc</strong> left off, minus the overselling of tickets and poorly managed site, (hopefully). Set to take place in Cornwall’s Trevelgue Holiday Park, it’s a reinvention of the <strong>Bloc</strong> formula with a new lease of life the idea most certainly needed. Plus the line-up looks fucking UNBELIEVABLE.
