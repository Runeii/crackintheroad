Having toured their home country extensively, and built up quite a following, the quartet are gearing up to release their debut LP later this year. Lead single <em>Far Away Place</em> is an upbeat, indie-pop number, drawing inspiration from Florence & The Machine, yet maintaining some semblance of songwriting sensibility. With the UK indie scene pitilessly staggering onto it’s cellulite infested last legs, it would be refreshing to see an act from outside our home country achieving critical success, and<strong> LA.VI</strong> may just be that band.
