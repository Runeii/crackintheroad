{"id":"5e9c06ae774c2610387e4edf","artists":["5e9b68da7a1236eccfeb1e8b"],"title":"New: Bovine – The Sun Never Sets On The British Empire","content":"<p>Jesus, small mercies.</p><p> I feel like I’ve been hollowed out and filled with badger dung. My skin is the papery consistency of dead petals. It might shatter if a breeze finds it. What I need is riffs. Big, heavy ones. Ones that slap you about a bit until you forget why you were even feeling all that delicate in the first place. <em><strong>The Sun Never Sets On The British</strong><strong> Empire</strong></em>, the debut full-length out today from Brummie guitar-botherers <strong>Bovine</strong>, is doing pretty sweet on that front.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2762267652/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Picking your way over this gnarly terrain, you’ll find warped, twisted versions of the landmarks you were expecting. Vocalist Marcus VVulfgang (yeah?) can sound a bit like John Garcia, he can sound a bit like Josh Homme, he can sound a bit like a phlegmy Chris Cornell when he feels like it<em>, </em>all honey-mellowed and smoky allure. The delay-soaked guitars on opener <em>Barium</em> or the title track, or the phaser that opens <em>I Will Make You Real </em>(before it decides to stove your head in) all point to plugging in, sparking up and zoning out. Stoner rock, n’est-ce pas?</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1397529263/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Almost. The filthy bar-sludge of <em>Thank Fuck I Ain’t You </em>(early contender for song title of the year, if that’s a thing) or <em>The Battle Of The Sinkhole</em> groove along at much the expected rate, but the well’s tainted with spikes of dissonance that you’d more likely find in hardcore than Kyuss. Then something like <em>Heroes Are What? </em>happens and it’s kind of like the way <em><strong>Up In Them Guts</strong></em><strong> </strong>pins you up by the throat against all the hopeless graffiti on a peeling toilet wall before whispering a beautiful secret in your ear and spitting whiskey in your eyes. It’s character forming and nastily life-affirming. It sounds nothing like <em><strong>Up In Them</strong><strong> Guts.</strong> </em>But this is stoner rock blasted forward by rocket fuel, the laziness and bloat that too often hangs around the genre given a damn good hiding by wild-eyed punk fury.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1239146182/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Don’t sleep for two nights, eat a slice of waxy pizza for breakfast, torch your last Camel and listen to Bovine.
