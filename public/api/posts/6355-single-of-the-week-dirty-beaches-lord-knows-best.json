Soaked in reverb and sorrow, the album has managed to split critical thinking. What’s been almost unanimous throughout the blogosphere however, are opinions of the track ‘Lord Knows Best’. The track holds to a simple melody and beat, as <strong>Alex Zhang Hungtai </strong>mumble s the moody and down trodden vocals we’re come to expect. “<em>I don’t give a damn, about anyone. But you.</em>” is just one example of the vulnerability paraded throughout the record. It’s almost impossible not to be swept away. Enjoy your week.
