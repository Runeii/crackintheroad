Having recently announced details of a handful of new live dates in Northern England, including support slots with Pretty Vicious and Blossoms, the four piece are also set to release their radio ready new single, <em>It’s Up To Me Now</em> on 13 November. There’s no pretentiousness, no quirky backstory, just solid, albeit endearingly gritty songwriting; in the words of frontman Andy Towse – <span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">“At the time I was writing it I’d just lost a decent job, so I had problems with money and I had people telling me that I didn’t have my head on straight and that being in a band doesn’t pay, so this song’s just about doing it anyway because you want to.”.</span></p>\n<p>With hints of recent Nothern success story Circa Waves, alongside all the best elements of Brit-pop – we’re talking catchy hooks and ever so slightly tongue in cheek lyrics, It’s Up To Me Now feels like an important moment in the fledgling career of Fronteers. Check it out below, alongside forthcoming live dates.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/224857495%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-hjsUt&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">September</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">20 – Rough Trade, Nottingham </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">26 – Night & Day, Manchester </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">27 – Trinity Festival, Hull </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">30 – Deaf Institute, Manchester * </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">October</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">07 – Brudnell Social Club, Leeds ** </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">08 – The Leadmill, Sheffield ** </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">10 – Twisterella Festival, Middlesbrough </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">* with Pretty Vicious ** with Blossoms</span></p>\n","slug":"31724-premiere-fronteers-its-up-to-me-now","category":"music","date":1442827237000,"wpid":31724,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1500,"height":1500,"src":"2015/09/11951610_956964457674901_635946481562370041_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgUGB//EACAQAAIBBAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECEQADEiEEBQYTYZH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Axv0ftuUnbciwLVtVRRliAMn0ZAiBrUUlPbfIc1ucxQ2wovNr6qWBOUyZoQ7gQGb9oP/Z"},"createdAt":1587280240979,"updatedAt":1588403508767,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2015/09/11951610_956964457674901_635946481562370041_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
