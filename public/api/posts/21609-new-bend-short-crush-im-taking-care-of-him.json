Their new double A single Short Crush / I’m Taking Care Of Him is an intoxicating mix of the previously mentioned acts, alongside touches of Vampire Weekend and Death Cab For Cutie. Verging upon sickly sweet at times, it’s slightly brash but expertly composed pop music, earmarking BEND as one of the finest new talents around.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F90073313\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F88228984\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21609-new-bend-short-crush-im-taking-care-of-him","category":"mpfree","date":1367402383000,"wpid":21609,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2013/05/941625_460637674006641_172198742_n-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQFBv/EACMQAAIBAwIHAQAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAEEQUhEyIjMUFRgqH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBv/EABkRAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMRIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AWsLSDVzBboFE6h34YU7elz52/ajHT7Mk9Rh8ihdyPFLbmJ2QkKCVOM8y1qJFVpGLKCSSSSO9H6mWldcp69P/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283549544,"updatedAt":1588443768613,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/05/941625_460637674006641_172198742_n-165x165.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
