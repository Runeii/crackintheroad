New track, <em>Bayberry Lane</em> is taken from their upcoming sophomore album, and plays heavily upon the softly delivered vocals and gradual epic crescendo. The quartet have also just released a video for the song, directed and shot by <strong>Charles Griffin Gibson</strong>, there’s plenty of bleak inner-city imagery and shots of the band in their rehearsal space, proving fitting fairly well with the downbeat atmosphere of <em>Bayberry Lane</em>.
