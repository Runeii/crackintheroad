{"id":"5e9c05a8774c2610387e4dcb","title":"Artist Profile: Demelza Watts","content":"<p>With such pieces titled <i>How to Escape an Art Exhibition </i>and <i>The Count</i> in which as soon as the viewer enters the gallery is right away ten counted out of it by a Boxing referee and then ousted by a burly bouncer, Demelza Watts isn’t going to be your average artist.</p><p> In fact, you may even wonder if you’re actually in an art exhibition at all. Demelza plays with your expectations of a gallery, creating these socially engaging and time based situational pieces that you may or may not see or even realize you’re a part of.</p>\n<p>Her <i>Waiting Room Art</i>, demonstrates this perfectly, several islands of a waiting room greets you at the entrance of the gallery, carpeted, with chairs and potted plants and several people sitting, waiting, but doing absolutely nothing, which also welcomes the idea of waiting as an endurance test. I don’t know the last time I sat at the doctors without fidgeting nervously with one bland magazine or another, but this uncanny scene of people waiting without such restlessness, suddenly makes you question this reality that’s been set up in front of you, you’ll have one eye on it for the rest of the exhibition so you can see immediately the slightest change in the sitters. Your gran might even rest her weary legs without noticing shes a performance artist.</p>\n<p>Demleza’s work is at the Wimbledon College of Art Degree Show till 22<sup>nd</sup> June</p>\n<p>For her website click <a href=\"https://cargocollective.com/demelzawatts\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p>Examples of her work are below</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/57692078\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"You're out of touch, I'm out of time.\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/67084311\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Time After Time\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-4 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-4 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 25%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-4 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-4 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */\n\t\t</style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-4' class='gallery galleryid-22641 gallery-columns-4 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://localhost:8888/arts/22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts/attachment/how-to-escape-an-art-exhibition'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://localhost:8888/uploads/2013/06/How-to-escape-an-Art-Exhibition-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/How-to-escape-an-Art-Exhibition-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/How-to-escape-an-Art-Exhibition-300x300.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/How-to-escape-an-Art-Exhibition-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://localhost:8888/arts/22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts/attachment/the-count'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Count-150x150.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Count-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Count-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Count-100x100.jpeg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://localhost:8888/arts/22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts/attachment/the-waiting-room'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Waiting-Room-150x150.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Waiting-Room-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Waiting-Room-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Waiting-Room-600x600.jpeg 600w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/The-Waiting-Room-100x100.jpeg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://localhost:8888/arts/22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts/attachment/waiting-room'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Waiting-Room-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Waiting-Room-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Waiting-Room-300x300.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Waiting-Room-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><br style=\"clear: both\" />\n\t\t</div>\n\n","slug":"22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts","category":"arts","date":1371735778000,"wpid":22641,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":670,"height":446,"src":"2013/06/the-count.jpeg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAIBAAAgEEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCAAQGEQUSFCExUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AnyDNkcaiaVBvfNs2Pt+obUDAH2Pp3WBZZjJtmhjlrLZrjKZAIGyPNKVJf//Z"},"createdAt":1587283368125,"updatedAt":1588403529627,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d17","old_image":"2013/06/the-count.jpeg","categories":["arts"]}
