It seems that as soon as one ex-Das Racist member releases something, the other is hot on his heels. Earlier today, <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20024-video-heems-desi-shoegaze-taiko/\" target=\"_blank\">Heems dropped the video for ‘Shoegaze Desi Taiko’</a> and then, mere hours later, Kool A.D. releases his own for the track ‘Moneyball’.</p>\n<p>The track, which is off his <em>63</em> mixtape, is one of the highlights of the album and the video differs quite dramatically from Heems’. Rather than being constructed from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_(film)\" target=\"_blank\">the beginning of a film</a>, ‘Moneyball’ finds Kool A.D. in a variety of psychedelic situations in which he is framed as some kind of bohemian overlord. It’s definitely a far artier affair than the Heems’ piece and has considerably more staying power, even if the concept is not quite as amusing.</p>\n<p>Still, whatever happens I’m delighted that both ex-members of Das Racist seem to have actually upped their activity levels since the group disbanded.
