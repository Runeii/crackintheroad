Loosen up and have a laugh.</p>\n<p>For Dominic’s website click <b><a href=\"https://dominicwatson.net/\">HERE</a><br />\n</b>and Vimeo Channel <strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/dominicwatson/videos\">HERE</a> </strong></p>\n<p>Check out his work at <b>Bloomberg New Contemporaries</b> at <b>Spike Island</b>, Bristol till the 10<sup>th</sup> November.
