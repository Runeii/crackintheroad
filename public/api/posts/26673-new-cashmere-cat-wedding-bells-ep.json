The piano arrangement that opens ‘With Me’ seems to initially suggest otherwise, before it is cut with the sampling and layering effects echoing some of the Scandinavian’s prior work. Still, there are some delicate and well-arranged moments here that are not really present in his earlier output. This extends onto the second track ‘Pearls’, which also resembles some earlier sounds with an added web of detail, but it is probably on the title-track where the most catchy and likeable moments are had. All four songs, however, are solid and ‘Wedding Bells’ gives out eighteen minutes of well-complemented grooves – an enjoyable fare, which won’t do the recent swell of Høiberg’s fanbase count any harm. It’s available to download now.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/8i87nlhmzLU\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26673-new-cashmere-cat-wedding-bells-ep","category":"music","date":1392214447000,"wpid":26673,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282435945,"updatedAt":1588441760359,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d4a","old_image":"generated/c2099c99ef84554ab7cd6cdd6bb7211e033e4ec9.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
