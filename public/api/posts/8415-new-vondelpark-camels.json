The more I hear from his imminent R&S release, <em>Nyc stuff and nyc bags</em>, the more I believe it could be one of my favourite EP releases of the year.  His latest release <em>Camels,</em> is banger in its own right, while subtly intertwining ghost like blemishes and haunting trains of thought. It’s what made me love the first half of his debut EP. It comes complete with a rather personal and mesmerising home video. Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yrCuRm-HqgU\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"425\" height=\"349\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"8415-new-vondelpark-camels","category":"music","date":1307478890000,"wpid":8415,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/06/vondelroof-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAHxAAAgICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwUGEQQSE3GR/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AxG3X2pfrSLbYqeZm7QxA5AHB9ybZtexI7KmeyyqpIAHWWAAfYiDoSX//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294308220,"updatedAt":1588443777773,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/06/vondelroof-292x50.jpg","categories":["music"]}
