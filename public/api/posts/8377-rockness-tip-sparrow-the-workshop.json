After <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/8298-interview-sparrow-and-the-workshop\">interviewing</a> and witnessing them last week on their extensive tour promoting new album Spitting Daggers, their infectious and passionate brand of indie-pop is sure to get the Inverness crowd dancing. Their debut album, Crystals Fall released last year through Distiller Records received widespread critical acclaim, and their sophomore record released earlier this week continues in a similar powerful yet evocative vein.</p>\n<p>Playing the Rock N Roll Circus stage on Sunday evening, you can be assured of a full-blooded performance from Jill, Nick and Gregor. Drawing comparisons to the likes of Black Sabbath, they create a phenomenal sound for a three piece; be sure to check out the angst driven Snakes In The Grass below.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13149016\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13149016\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/rocketpr/sparrow-and-the-workshop\">Sparrow and the Workshop – Snakes in the Grass</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/rocketpr\">rocketpr</a></span></p>\n","slug":"8377-rockness-tip-sparrow-the-workshop","category":"festivals","date":1307285728000,"wpid":8377,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/06/sparrow-and-workshop-ireland-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAeEAADAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMAETEFBkKBkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwC/6RNE73eqIq1M6KXA0dFuN+h8y6pKZoxM05PiMYwJS7Q//9k="},"createdAt":1587294316212,"updatedAt":1588403554509,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/sparrow-and-workshop-ireland-292x50.jpg","categories":["festivals","music"]}
