Everything about his music is energetic, brash, vibrant, off the wall and ultimately completely batshit insane, yet deliriously brilliant. I can’t even begin to work out where the samples are lifted from, and perhaps for the best, perhaps it would remove some of the magic. Check out <em>fracture</em>, <em>relapse</em> and his Childish Gambino remix below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/181192481&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180154707&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/181192302&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30369-introducing-keii","category":"introducing","date":1418435987000,"wpid":30369,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1161,"height":1161,"src":"2014/12/a1962356684_10.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQIH/8QAIBAAAgEEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQSIREFMUFhgf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIG/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEQMSMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A1InFpFkV2OgCV7D5VPDBm2MuudaprptzOthbhZpQAgHAc0DdSObmUl2JLnz7qiTLuxXlRrYNgmf/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587281783970,"updatedAt":1588403513459,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/12/a1962356684_10.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
