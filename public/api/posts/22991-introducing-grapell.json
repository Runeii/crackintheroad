With lines like ‘<em>A little kiss behind the pole / A white fox in the snow / When someone held a weapon to your throat / Then I knew what to do</em>‘, lyrically it’s rather despairing at points, yet with an undercurrent of uplifting optimism. Of the three tracks, EP closer <em>Fire Between</em> is the standout, a compelling love song that’s elegantly rounded and assured.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F4849029\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22991-introducing-grapell","category":"introducing","date":1373470187000,"wpid":22991,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283289596,"updatedAt":1588441764585,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/94ad3a5860b841d2d510105d814eadde7918f53f.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
