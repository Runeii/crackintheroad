From humble beginnings recording<strong> Drake</strong> covers in the confines of her bedroom, to unleashing a behemoth of a debut album at the end of August; Rochelle Jordan has already traveled a long way in such a short space of time. New cut <em>_Shot</em> is a glowing, synth driven track, poignant and despairingly haunting. It’s wonderfully grounding yet heart-wrenching to hear <strong>Rochelle’s</strong> vivid story-telling; whilst at the same time forming a brilliant introduction for those who are still to hear <strong>Rochelle’s</strong> music.</p>\n<p>Check out <em>_Shot</em> below, and head over to<strong> Rochelle’s</strong> <a href=\"https://rojoproto.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> for free downloads of all her material to date.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1492655602/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11923-introducing-rochelle-jordan","category":"introducing","date":1319148054000,"wpid":11923,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293677356,"updatedAt":1588441788067,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/8bd0c7872ef145892e6c9a5a969ee8aa11392135.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
