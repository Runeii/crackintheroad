I’ve been bashing on a lot about how summer is just around the corner recently and I’m going to do it again. This is your new soundtrack for summertime heartbreak.</p>\n<p>Their sophomore album <em>Youth Culture Forever</em> is out 2nd June via <strong>FatCat</strong>.</p>\n","slug":"28047-new-paws-owls-talons-clenching-heart","category":"introducing","date":1398355135000,"wpid":28047,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282181280,"updatedAt":1588441758049,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"generated/57aff6e0adaa1951c4f0139951dd5e3d4e67f4c1.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
