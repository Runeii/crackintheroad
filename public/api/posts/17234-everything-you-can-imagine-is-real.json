If you’re an avid follower of <em><strong>CitR</strong></em>, you’ll notice that all have appeared on the blog before, many making their online debut, however for those more casual readers, I implore you to take a chance. So without further ado, I present to you the first in a three part series of compilations: <em><strong>Everything You Can Imagine Is Real.</strong></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2012/07/everythingyoucanback1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-archives wp-image-17250\" title=\"Everything You Can Imagine Is Real Back\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/07/everythingyoucanback1-350x350.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/07/everythingfront1.jpg\"><img title=\"Everything You Can Imagine Is Real Front\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/07/everythingfront1-350x350.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2206832&show_artwork=true&secret_token=s-bfjdY\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n<p>For more information on the artists, follow the links below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://avecsans.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Avec Sans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://moodindigo.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mood Indigo</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/athaliamusic\" target=\"_blank\">ATHALIA</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deathtodreaming.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Death to Dreaming</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nobleoak\" target=\"_blank\">Noble Oak</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"sweetvalleyslumberparty.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sweet Valley Slumber Party</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chateaudoesnotexist.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chateau</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/l_e_r_k\" target=\"_blank\">LERK</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://campcounselors.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CAMP COUNSELORS</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryingatprom.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Prom</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beaufieldsband.bandcamp.com/track/lost-at-last-live\" target=\"_blank\">Beaufields</a></p>\n<p>NB: All tracks featured are available for free download elsewhere, however if you are the owner of any of the music and would like to be removed from the compilation, then please do not hesitate to get in touch and I’ll happily remove the offending track.</p>\n","slug":"17234-everything-you-can-imagine-is-real","category":"editorials","date":1341840693000,"wpid":17234,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284957721,"updatedAt":1588441775888,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/55095ee2e061a65dc035d82135f3b9c5546495a8.jpg","categories":["editorials","mixtapes","music"]}
