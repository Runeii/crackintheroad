With <strong>The Weeknd</strong>’s Mixtape being lapped up by underground kids and the mainstream alike, it seems like the perfect time for <strong>Frank Ocean</strong> to drop the video for his radio crossover tune, <em>Novocane</em>.</p>\n<p>And what a video it is. Shot in one take/shot, disturbingly distorted and smutty imagery are gently overlaid on the ominous main shot.  Out of the whole of <strong>OFWGKTA, Frank Ocean</strong> has been the most confident with playing with genre convention, he also seems to be just as confident with playing with the very fabric  of what a music video can achieve.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dipDt8_O7zU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"8619-video-frank-ocean-novacane","category":"music","date":1308318717000,"wpid":8619,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":503,"src":"2011/06/novacane.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAHRAAAgICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEQUhAwQSQf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMNyWI4uq6VRDn0prdD4ZOMerANSb3EScBb/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294277944,"updatedAt":1588403553925,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/06/novacane.jpg","categories":["music"]}
