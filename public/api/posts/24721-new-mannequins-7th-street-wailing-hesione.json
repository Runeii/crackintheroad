Minimal, understated, yet beauteous in all the right moments, finding solace in the sparse beat and gorgeous lyricism. Early days but I’ve no doubt this will turn many heads; <strong>Mannequins on 7th Street</strong> are a mightily exciting prospect.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116250976\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24721-new-mannequins-7th-street-wailing-hesione","category":"mpfree","date":1382567000000,"wpid":24721,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":709,"src":"2013/10/1392832_492297887535666_2048491078_n-950x709.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAIhAAAQMDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBAMFERITMQchIkGB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIVw6pXCfDp0JEGF4N07lJm28nJySRycED5n2sqb4HEl0Zpce5Os8oiD/9k="},"createdAt":1587282840816,"updatedAt":1588443766309,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/10/1392832_492297887535666_2048491078_n-950x709.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
