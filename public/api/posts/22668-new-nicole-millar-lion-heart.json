As we’ve come to expect from electronic Australian music, the production is spotlessly sleek, and glistening with Millar’s silky smooth vocals. Not to discredit her previous work, but with more tracks of similar quality to Lion Heart, there’s no reason why <strong>Nicole Millar</strong> can’t be a pop-star in her own right.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F95839452\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22668-new-nicole-millar-lion-heart","category":"music","date":1371764619000,"wpid":22668,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283365233,"updatedAt":1588441765150,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/1d58e09443972d6c02beb2d3fcec01cb08c8cd89.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
