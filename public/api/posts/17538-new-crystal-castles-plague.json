{"id":"5e9c0b80774c2610387e531b","artists":["5e9b68e07a1236eccfeb1f35"],"title":"New: Crystal Castles – Plague","content":"<p>Two years on since their last album, and <strong>Crystal Castles</strong> sound as fresh as ever.</p><p> Whilst not leaving behind the sound of their sophomore record that impressed so many, new track Plague moves towards an even more trance and acid-house inspired place. Barely audible vocals from<strong> Alice Glass</strong> and a wall of disturbed synths tremor throughout, shaking loose the two years that they’ve spent in hibernation, as well as any of the petty rave connotations that many initially stuck them with.
