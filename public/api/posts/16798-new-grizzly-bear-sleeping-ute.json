Now, I’m yet to be completely sold on <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong>, but from a few listens to this track it appears they’ve ditched the more intimate quality found on previous records, and adopted a more stadium rock approach. Check out <em>Sleeping Ute</em> below, taken from their as yet untitled fourth album, out 17 September, more info <a href=\"grizzly-bear.net\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hk3tURx8a2Q\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p>SEPTEMBER<br />\n16 Knoxville, TN @ Tennessee Theater<br />\n17 Atlanta, GA @ The Tabernacle<br />\n18 Nashville, TN @ Ryman Auditorium<br />\n20 Washington, DC @ 9:30 Club<br />\n21 Washington, DC @ 9:30 Club<br />\n22 Boston, MA @ Orpheum Theater<br />\n23 Montreal, QC @ L’Olympia<br />\n24 New York, NY @ Radio City Music Hall<br />\n26 Toronto, ON @ Massey Hall<br />\n28 Cincinnati, OH @ MidPoint Music Festival<br />\n29 Champaign, IL @ Pygmalion Music Festival<br />\n30 Chicago, IL @ Riviera Theatre</p>\n<p>OCTOBER<br />\n01 Minneapolis, MN @ First Avenue<br />\n04 Portland, OR @ Keller Auditorium<br />\n05 Seattle, Washington @ Paramount Theatre<br />\n06 Vancouver, BC @ Commodore Ballroom<br />\n09 Oakland, CA @ Fox Theater<br />\n10 Los Angeles, CA @ Greek Theater<br />\n17 Gateshead, UK @ The Sage Gateshead<br />\n18 Manchester, UK @ Academy<br />\n20 Glasgow, UK @ Barrowland Ballroom<br />\n21 Coventry, UK @ Warwick Arts Centre<br />\n22 London, UK @ Brixton Academy<br />\n26 Oslo, Norway @ Rockefeller<br />\n27 Stockholm, Sweden @ Berns Salonger<br />\n28 Copenhagen, Denmark @ Falconer Salen<br />\n30 Hamburg, Germany @ Uebel & Gefärlich<br />\n31 Berlin, Germany @ Astra</p>\n<p>NOVEMBER<br />\n02 Köln, Germany @ Essigfabrik<br />\n03 Paris, France @ Pitchfork Festival<br />\n04 Brussels, Belgium @ Ancienne Belgique<br />\n05 Amsterdam, Holland @ Paradiso<br />\n20 Wellington, New Zealand @ Opera House<br />\n21 Auckland, New Zealand @ Bruce Mason</p>\n","slug":"16798-new-grizzly-bear-sleeping-ute","category":"music","date":1338923117000,"wpid":16798,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285149022,"updatedAt":1588441777364,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/986d8d77dac4a075ebb30338f6db85ea923144be.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
