Their support of <strong>WU LYF’s</strong> UK tour has been well publicised with <strong>Family</strong> gaining a fair amount of support because of the news. Regardless of the partnership, Family are a band that can stand up on their own two feet. Full of glistening, strained and souring vocals blended with lo-fi tones and textures, they manage to be relatable while still straying into areas that seem new and prosperous. Their new EP is a folk fueled little gem, check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2096437355/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://family.bandcamp.com/album/family-iii\">Family III by Family</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"7508-introducing-family","category":"music","date":1304853958000,"wpid":7508,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/05/family-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAiEAACAgAEBwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAwACBBETIQUGEiMyQVH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBP/EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMUH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AK7ltCU8MC0qWummT00qAM998pLYhS9dnbp5H0PsRCVKdf/Z"},"createdAt":1587294410831,"updatedAt":1588443778113,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/05/family-292x50.jpg","categories":["music"]}
