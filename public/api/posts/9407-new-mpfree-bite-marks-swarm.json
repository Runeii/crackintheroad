Hell, even I’ve been known to have an occasional jam session now and then. So it’s no surprise that amongst the scores of bedroom producers, it takes a truly inspired moment to leap out from the crowd, and this is exactly what this track from BITE MARKS does. Opening with a rather overly repetitive sample, it’s not until the languid vocals enter that the track begins to lurch elegantly into life.</p>\n<p>The lo-fi undertones are strikingly coherent and effective, as the track twists between muffled vocals and violin like samples. There’s touches of Purity Ring and Waskerley Way on SWARM, yet there’s a feeling that BITE MARKS aims to mould a sound entirely their own, and which will hopefully be found on future tracks.
