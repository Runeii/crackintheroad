Well this ‘new’ track from Manchester’s <strong>Shinies</strong> is sort of like that, albeit only their second version of it… oh and it’s not shit either.</p><p> In fact, the decision to re-record is pretty understandable when you consider that the demo of <em>Spent Youth</em> was recorded on a limb and inside their own modest budget. Having seen <strong>Shinies</strong> play in Newcastle a week or two back, I can wholeheartedly confirm that <em>Spent Youth</em> is as ballbusting live as on record, with it’s sexual frustration and jilted teenage angst.
