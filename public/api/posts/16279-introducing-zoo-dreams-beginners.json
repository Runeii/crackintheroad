The project of Scott and Caitlin, their debut EP<em><strong> Beginners</strong></em>, is a wonderfully upbeat affair, swinging from the jerky guitar line of <em>We’re All Wandering</em> to the lullaby-esque nature of the title track.</p>\n<p>Comparisons may be drawn to <strong>Best Coast</strong>, yet there’s a more refined edge to <strong>Zoo Dreams</strong>, sounding slicker and less drug-induced. So it verges upon sickly sweet at times (<em>‘life’s not so bad if you give it some time’</em>), however I challenge anyone to listen to<em> Beginners</em> and not feel driven to up-sticks and live by the coast for the rest of their days. So whilst we may be swarming with 80’s obsessed surf-pop groups at the moment, there’s certainly room for the mightily impressive <strong>Zoo Dreams</strong>.
