Kickass shoegaze influences? You bet. LA’s <strong>Wild Eyes</strong> are pretty much the ideal post-2010 band, the image, the sound and the talent are there in abundance, and they aren’t afraid to express it. You get the impression that their parents probably played them <em>Loveless</em> or <em>Vapour Trail</em> (<strong>Ride</strong>) as a substitute for bedtime stories, and instead of collecting baseball cards, they spent all their paper round earnings on reverb pedals and retro-amps.</p>\n<p>It’s nigh on impossible to reference a nu-gaze band without bringing up<strong> Pains of Being Pure At Heart</strong> or <strong>The Horrors</strong>, the two pioneers of the shoegaze inspired genre, yet <strong>Wild Eyes</strong> are by far more exciting. Not ashamed of their background, the likes of riff heavy <em>When Its Over</em> and the upbeat <em>Summer</em> cavort with a grungy strut that truly marks them out as a one to watch for the rest of 2012.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"410\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1125433847/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://wildeyestheband.bandcamp.com/album/blue-haze-ep\">Blue Haze EP by Wild Eyes</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16859-introducing-wild-eyes","category":"introducing","date":1339251747000,"wpid":16859,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285118010,"updatedAt":1588441777041,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2732a856e09ff6a24f849fd3c6c.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
