Ohio’s <strong>Ouisa Hound</strong> talks about his own music with such eloquence that it’s already irresistible before you’ve even heard a note of it.</p><p> These two debut tracks from the anonymous bedroom producer are “the bookends of a forthcoming album titled “The Joy Eclectic,”” and allow the brain to ponder just exactly where the rest of the record will go from here. Focusing on minimal and ambient aspirations, <strong>Ouisa Hound</strong> comes across as an expert story teller, despite both pieces being entirely instrumental.</p>\n<p>Take the gorgeous roll of <em>Well Overtaken</em>, as it pirouettes sumptuously through steady percussion sections and inspired samples. Other track <em>Gloom Roaming</em> wonders the desolate soundscape it creates in such a fashion that leaves the listener craving for further transcendental experiences. Comparison wise, it’s impossible to pin down<strong> Ouisa Hound</strong>, there appear to be elements of <strong>Sigur Ros</strong> amongst the angelic sampled vocal harmonies, yet it’s grounded by a wonderful drone-based platform. With <em><strong>The Joy Ecletic</strong></em> out next year, I’m clinging on to these two tracks in the meantime, dreaming of just how beautiful this record may well be. Hear both cuts below.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F30551242\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F30551242\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound/well-overtaken\">Well Overtaken</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound\">Ouisa Hound</a></span></p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F30549493\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F30549493\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound/gloom-roaming\">Gloom Roaming</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound\">Ouisa Hound</a></span></p>\n","slug":"13120-introducing-ouisa-hound","category":"introducing","date":1323883527000,"wpid":13120,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":332,"src":"2011/12/ouisa+hound+bresson.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMH/8QAIRAAAQMDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEEgUGByExQYH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Apf7i5LvW1YjRbJtcFhDSMitM9wo9iB5mJrP7rUeRDcvFbhzzMxeqAmfQC4HylKD/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293256142,"updatedAt":1588403544097,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/12/ouisa+hound+bresson.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
