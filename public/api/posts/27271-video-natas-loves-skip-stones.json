The new video for track <em>Skip Stones</em> features footage of a trip to India and serves as a perfect backdrop to the slick production and infectiously catchy hook. Think <strong>Passion Pit</strong> mashed with <strong>MGMT</strong>, with a little <strong>Metronomy</strong> thrown in for good measure. In other words, perfect daytime festival music.</p>\n<p>You can watch the video for <em>Skip</em> <em>Stones</em> above</p>\n","slug":"27271-video-natas-loves-skip-stones","category":"music","date":1394571932000,"wpid":27271,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282346268,"updatedAt":1588441760115,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"generated/4f445c203272c80663bc080435b5aa9e3d77140a.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
