Hell, that piano line is rather hilarious at times. Yet strangely enough, it all actually serves to make their debut outing, <em>HVP</em>, all the more appealing. So The National reference is there to be heard, perhaps not as strong as they assume, instead it’s influences from The Killers and Springsteen that shine through. Where HVP really flexes it’s muscles is through it’s lyrics, which I’m sure Berninger himself would be proud of – “you were in the car / burned into my skin / how was I to know / stretched across the sky / piss drunk chasing fireflies”.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3318638078/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27945-introducing-voyeurs","category":"introducing","date":1397745076000,"wpid":27945,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":50,"height":50,"src":"2014/04/a3377558828_10-50x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQQH/8QAJBAAAQQBAwMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBREEADFBBhITISKRobH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBP/EABkRAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAAIhMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AyGRxonGi8bGbyF+d9KVrfT7kuGz6AHYDiqvnTDXQfc0g+K7SDZcr607MxMcmQhAnAxADHKJplO4UmjtxZ+dXsEhhsAkAJH5oKNdllyHgE//Z"},"createdAt":1587282208647,"updatedAt":1588403516850,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/04/a3377558828_10-50x50.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
