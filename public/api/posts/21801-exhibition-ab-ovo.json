In the space films sit alongside structured canvas frame sculptures and vast frameless canvases sweep the floor of the galley, punctuated with a procession of shelved eggs along one wall.</p>\n<p>For me I particularly enjoyed the narrative surrounding the “sea paintings” as a body of work, made by throwing mineral pigments directly onto a canvas that was submerged in waves at the seashore and the enormous pieces of fabric are dragged along the sand. The process is a physical one and is strongly as a representation of the artists performances.</p>\n<p>The use of such emblematic land masses such as the sea, or the egg, brings our physical prehistory into an exploration with a fresh modernist abstraction.</p>\n<p>Come along and see Warboys for yourself until 16th June…</p>\n<div>For More Details and Events From Spike Island <a href=\"https://www.spikeisland.org.uk/\"><strong>CLICK HERE </strong></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */\n\t\t</style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-2' class='gallery galleryid-21801 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://localhost:8888/arts/21801-exhibition-ab-ovo/attachment/jessica-warboys-kite-kite-ab-ovo_event_image'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://localhost:8888/uploads/2013/05/jessica-warboys-kite-kite-ab-ovo_event_image-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/jessica-warboys-kite-kite-ab-ovo_event_image-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/jessica-warboys-kite-kite-ab-ovo_event_image-300x300.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/jessica-warboys-kite-kite-ab-ovo_event_image-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://localhost:8888/arts/21801-exhibition-ab-ovo/attachment/jessica-warboys-pageant-roll-ab-ovo-1_mobile_thumb'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/jessica-warboys-pageant-roll-ab-ovo-1_mobile_thumb-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/jessica-warboys-pageant-roll-ab-ovo-1_mobile_thumb-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/jessica-warboys-pageant-roll-ab-ovo-1_mobile_thumb-300x300.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/jessica-warboys-pageant-roll-ab-ovo-1_mobile_thumb-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://localhost:8888/arts/21801-exhibition-ab-ovo/attachment/photo-41'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/photo-41-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/photo-41-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/photo-41-300x300.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/photo-41-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><br style=\"clear: both\" /><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://localhost:8888/?attachment_id=21797'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/photo-32-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/photo-32-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/05/photo-32-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl>\n\t\t\t<br style='clear: both' />\n\t\t</div>\n\n</div>\n<div></div>\n","slug":"21801-exhibition-ab-ovo","category":"arts","date":1368115204000,"wpid":21801,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283518462,"updatedAt":1587825872212,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d15","categories":["arts"]}
