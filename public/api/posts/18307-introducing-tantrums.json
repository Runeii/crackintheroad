Recorded with the help of Pablo Clements and James Griffith in Brighton earlier this year, it’s a collection of sparse, brooding pop numbers, both dreamy and nightmarish at the same time.</p>\n<p>Marking a clear distinction between vocal and instrumental sections (<em>Pikaia</em>), the five piece draw from <strong>Cocteau Twins</strong> and <strong>Foals</strong> with the swirling, at times menacing atmosphere conjured up. Personal favourite <em>Stella</em> is a gorgeous vocal led number, with lead singer <strong>Jade McInally</strong> backed almost solely by a sultry piano and a rigid drum machine.
