If there is one artist who is our generation’s Michael Jackson, it’s the mighty JT. If that doesn’t excite you, and I don’t know why it wouldn’t, consider that if MJ was the eighties’ Marvin Gaye, then Timberlake is our version of the peerless soul singer. If, for some reason or other, you feel that the two more modern singers are not in the same league as Gaye and are evidence of the decline of popular music, then quiet yourself, fool. We’re better off now, we can listen to all three of them as much as we want.</p>\n<p><i>FutureSex/LoveSounds </i>was, and still is, a great album, especially to bump uglies to, and I’m hoping he follows where he left off<i>. </i>The artwork is pretty stylish and slick, once again following in the wake of his last album. <i>The 20/20 Experience</i> is out on the 17th March on RCA, find the artwork and tracklist below.</p>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-archives wp-image-19493\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/02/JT_The_20_20_Experience_Album_Small-350x350.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" />\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>01</b> Pusher Love Girl</p>\n<p><b>02</b> Suit & Tie</p>\n<p><b>03</b> Don’t Hold the Wall</p>\n<p><b>04</b> Strawberry Bubblegum</p>\n<p><b>05</b> Tunnel Vision</p>\n<p><b>06</b> Spaceship Coupe</p>\n<p><b>07</b> That Girl</p>\n<p><b>08</b> Let the Groove Get In</p>\n<p><b>09</b> Mirrors</p>\n<p><b>10</b> Blue Ocean Floor</p>\n","slug":"19491-news-justin-timberlake-releases-2020-experience-tracklist-and-artwork","category":"music","date":1360229453000,"wpid":19491,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284037811,"updatedAt":1588441790683,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/5b73ff32952c810c98bd5fbe8860ca99414ad6aa.jpg","categories":["music","news"]}
