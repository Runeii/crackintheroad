The man responsible for producing MGMT’s Congratulations album last year.</p>\n<p>Talking about the epic yet somewhat repetitive soundscapes created on Person Pitch, Noah believes he has restyled himself for the new release “I got tired of the severe parameters of using samplers. Thinking about Nirvana and the White Stripes got me into the idea of doing something with a heavy focus on guitar and rhythm.”</p>\n<p>In comparison to Person Pitch, Tomboy promises to be a completely different animal, the heavier rock vibe contrasted with another influence on Lennox’s style – “With regards to where I am with Tomboy, I’m definitely reliving middle school and all the Baltimore R & B radio we used to ingest.”</p>\n<p>Music news site I Guess I’m Floating posted a video yesterday featuring a new Panda Bear track “Atiba Song” which is expected to be on the new album. Watch it above.</p>\n<p>Tomboy will be released April 19th via Lennox’s own label Paw-Tracks – <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.paw-tracks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.paw-tracks.com/</a></p>\n","slug":"4041-news-panda-bears-back-in-business","category":"music","date":1295114805000,"wpid":4041,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1920,"height":1080,"src":"2011/01/panda_still2.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABRMxBggi/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAZEQADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDISL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AInsj5TEkuapMaM6JLaSrkXQ+CSKFHu03mDK2zxUTzPCz0FYxkzwkpGWVVbR/9k="},"createdAt":1587294818499,"updatedAt":1588403561438,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2011/01/panda_still2.jpg","categories":["music"]}
