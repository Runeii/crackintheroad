When Clyde’s acoustic guitar and vocals come in the song begins to feel slightly more contemporary and youthful. Despite the acoustic being so low in the mix the instrumentation politely nods to Where Is My Mind era Pixies with Clyde’s voice sounding like a Joplin inspired Amelia Meath (of Sylvan Esso). The performances in the track perfectly reflect the bedroom-jam mood set by the lyrics of a child fighting the will of a parent to “start a new life”, using the cleaner production of the lead slide-guitar to mimic the emotionally soothing qualities of Clyde’s voice. With now two tastefully refreshing approaches to a more mature sound 2017 looks bright for Cat Clyde.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqXdU1IK2JI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33041-new-cat-clyde-mama-said","category":"music","date":1481814110000,"wpid":33041,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587279942787,"updatedAt":1588442049875,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"generated/2c6bd79fc324f288deb28464998cfd57282a4558.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
