{"id":"5e9c0aff774c2610387e5295","artists":["5e9b69177a1236eccfeb226a"],"title":"Introducing: Left Right Arms","content":"<p>Japan is slowly but surely making its mark on the world of DIY music, largely down to the sudden influx of shoegaze inspired guitar bands.</p><p> With the internet allowing their music to travel overseas, it’s a scene that sure to blossom in the coming years, and <strong>Left Right Arms</strong> may well be at the forefront of said movement. With two rough bedroom recorded demo’s to his name so far, and little other information, it’s difficult to understand what direction <strong>Left Right Arms</strong> is coming from, however given the quality of the two tracks, they’re more than worthy of writing about.</p>\n<p><em>Ascend Soon</em> is a gorgeously layered melodic number, merging subtle and fragile moments of undiluted bliss, there’s touches of<strong> Washed Out</strong> yet without the overpowering synth sections. Whilst the vocals touch upon strained at times, there’s no doubting the abundance of talent on display, and with higher quality production, <em>Ascend Soon</em> has all the makings of a blog-favourite. On the flip side, <em>Twelve Oaks</em> is a more unabashed pop gem, fusing samples and delicate riffs with the understated vocals of the unnamed singer. I seem to use the phrase ‘it’s still early days’ in almost every CitR piece, however a few more tracks to this sort of quality, and who knows where <strong>Left Right Arms</strong> could go.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3646549253/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=180738560/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17844-introducing-left-right-arms","category":"introducing","date":1347032259000,"wpid":17844,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":629,"src":"2012/09/1128058134-1-950x629.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEEBgUhExSh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAX/xAAZEQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADEUH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AN7SNUGDgSRe81uO6yHGK5A4mwejRIVZeBeJHhuw5obZoeEdfURTUucjSYpqkHJ//9k="},"createdAt":1587284735731,"updatedAt":1588443772525,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/09/1128058134-1-950x629.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
