The centre -sort of somewhere in between a visit to a Cava factory and a Lambrini bottling plant –  will be opening later this year.</p>\n<p>To celebrate they asked students – and other Londoners – to take photos of what the city meant to them (well, actually, they asked what #MyLondon meant to them, but c’mon, unnecessary hashtags in 2013? Business wouldn’t have denigrated themselves like that in my day) and to send them in. These were then used as part of a giant laser-projection in Covent Garden Market to showcase the creative energy of the internationally renowned college.</p>\n<p>Of these, judges then selected 1,000 to make up the limited edition bottle design – the finished version of which you can see in the video below.</p>\n<p>You can even drink it at your desk because <em>lunch is for wimps</em>.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>To celebrate the launch, Beefeater are letting anyone send a ‘#MyLondon’ postcard to their friends – for free – via their Facebook page. I personally just sent one to my boy Jeffrey Skilling, let him know someone is still thinking about him, just like those Amnesty Campaigns.
