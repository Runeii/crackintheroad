Whilst already sounding like the finished product can help a band in the initial stages, it can leave them with little room for progression, and doesn’t allow the listener the beauty of being able to witness the group mature and ultimately find their musical home. Or, <strong>Apes & Horses</strong> could just always have been bloody brilliant.</p>\n<p>Either way, <strong>Apes & Horses</strong> definitely fall into the bracket of already having a polished, well rounded and distinctive sound, it just remains to be seen as to whether they can continue to progress. Of the new tracks <em>The Fields</em> comes complete with <strong>WU LYF</strong> guitar sound and wholesome vocals whereas <em>Magenta</em> is a refined, melancholic number, the less immediate of the two but ultimately more rewarding.
