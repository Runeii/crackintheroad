BT – Long Time Coming","content":"<p>I must have played this track four or five times in the past couple of hours, and I still can’t put my finger on which part of it doesn’t quite work.</p><p> It’s an intriguing make-up; mixing a plucked acoustic guitar, <strong>Notorious B.I.G.</strong> style vocals (<strong>BT</strong>) and a silky smooth, slightly cheesy pop inspired chorus (<strong>Mark Rodriguez</strong>).<em> Long Time Coming</em> reminds me of those ‘uplifting’ rap tracks that used to be released around 04/05, the perfect example being <strong>Twista & Faith Evans</strong> rendition of <em>Hope</em>, which soundtracked Coach Carter. So it’s fairly cliched, and not going to win any records for originally, but it gives me that warm fuzzy reeling in my stomach, and hey, isn’t that what music should do?</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=576634054/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://markrodriguez1.bandcamp.com/track/long-time-coming\">Long Time Coming by Mark Rodriguez Feat.
