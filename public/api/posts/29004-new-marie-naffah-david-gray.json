It looks at the way “<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">certain songs will forever remind you of a particular person and make you so happy that you feel like you could burst”</span>. There’s nothing soppy about this track, it’s full of summer and life, so grab your shoes and join her in dancing at the <em>hardware store..</em> or in the park with some beers.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/157276042&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29004-new-marie-naffah-david-gray","category":"music","date":1404928030000,"wpid":29004,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282060650,"updatedAt":1588441756216,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d09","old_image":"generated/d0dcfa651b28238be23fbf44b3f10f8406f7ea14.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
