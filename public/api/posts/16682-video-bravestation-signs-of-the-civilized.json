Not only are they cracking guys, but they also write some of the most infectious melodies around, as portrayed by recent single <em>Signs of the Civilized</em>, a gloriously epic track, destined to propel them to greater heights. Accompanied by the wonderfully poetic Game of Thrones inspired video, <em>Signs of the Civilized</em> is taken from their upcoming debut album entitled <em><strong>Giants & Dreamers</strong></em> out 10 July. Oh and as if you need any more persuading, the video contains several rather attractive young women.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG2hyYLVSIM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16682-video-bravestation-signs-of-the-civilized","category":"music","date":1337978529000,"wpid":16682,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587286973910,"updatedAt":1588441777549,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-25-at-22.37.20-165x66.png","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
