It’s been a long time coming. After <em>36</em>, the album’s first leak, we now have <em>cablecar</em> – a meandering, highly experimental odyssey of psychN’B. Which despite my best intentions is likely never to be a thing.</p>\n<p><em>Cablecar</em> is the bleakest<strong> Kwes</strong> track so far, each of the track’s many facets almost seem like punctuations to the drone like ambience that existed before and after the track’s 8 minute duration. It’s at times feverish, at others reluctantly optimistic – but it always hangs with a consuming level of fragility.</p>\n<p>Hit play below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F113327805\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><b><i>ilp</i></b><b> Tracklist:</b></p>\n<p>01. purplehands<br />\n02. 36<br />\n03. rollerblades<br />\n04. cablecar<br />\n05. flower<br />\n06. hives<br />\n07. broke<br />\n08. chagall<br />\n09. parakeet<br />\n10. b_shf_l</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"24477-new-kwes-cablecar","category":"music","date":1380732959000,"wpid":24477,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282917909,"updatedAt":1588441761805,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/fc8f86303964a93262b9724338062d5305ddc984.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
