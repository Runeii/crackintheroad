Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2015/03/30/get-down-with-ben-khans-new-single-zenith\" target=\"_blank\">Fader</a>, Khan describes the story behind Zenith as <span style=\"color: #222222;\">“A superhero goes to die by lying on the sun, ashamed of what he has done, he begs his love for forgiveness so he can return. But his fate is sealed, and he slowly burns to death. What he has done is not to be made clear. The term ‘Zenith’ can be used to describe the highest point of ones success. But in this story, the Zenith reached is the astrological point where he meets his demise on the sun.” Check it out below, tour dates <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/benkhanmusic/app_123966167614127\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and pre-order 1000 <a href=\"https://po.st/1000EP\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/198378402%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-9wMEn&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31172-new-ben-khan-zenith","category":"music","date":1427717999000,"wpid":31172,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587280351531,"updatedAt":1588441752967,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ffe0853169dfa21cee86d80de65e2f034f7d766a.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
