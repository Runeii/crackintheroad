That said, for what it is, it’s still a bloody brilliant collection of tracks.</p>\n<p>Soulful, unique and dazzlingly full of character, there’s moments of <strong>Björk</strong>-esque grandeur (<em>Modern Confusion</em>) and <em>James Blake</em> styled intimacy, all supported by<strong> Elle’s</strong> impeccable vocals. As with <strong>Blake</strong>, <strong>Leatham</strong> utilizes the silences to inspiring effect, most notably on the layered vocals of <em>Children</em>, with the textured layers adding a depth that is understandably difficult to achieve for a singular person. The beats do occasionally lack a kick, however as previously mentioned, it’s no fault of her own, and given the modest means by which <strong><em>Callous</em></strong> has been produced, it’s a stunning listen. Check out a couple of personal highlights below, and head to <strong>Elle’s</strong><a href=\"https://elleleatham.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> bandcamp</a> to grab the full release.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3999478421/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2342396048/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://elleleatham.bandcamp.com/track/pay-for-this\">pay for this by Elle Leatham</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16662-introducing-elle-leatham","category":"introducing","date":1337810050000,"wpid":16662,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":210,"src":"2012/05/2180877479-1-165x210.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAANAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwIE/8QAIxAAAgIBAwMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCEQQAEiEFImEGMXGRof/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAED/8QAGREAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABEy/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAj1FmMWumFLxVASc2baMQTViIHP54vTHKZZ7l/WtbPSuF1CL1uY7bJEYS7uCAzdfzcffydXJGNuNpJN8needEqrQdXWeDp7I3/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587287231767,"updatedAt":1588443773887,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/05/2180877479-1-165x210.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
