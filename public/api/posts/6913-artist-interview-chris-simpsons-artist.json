Itâ€™s not hard to see why when looking at his work. \t\tFocusing almost entirely on drawings, his work seeks to capture the essence and indeed realisms of the \t\tcharacters found in the hit TV show, â€˜The Simpsonsâ€™. Perhaps the most striking aspect of </span><strong \t\tstyle=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Chris </strong><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">(Simpsons Artistâ€™s)</strong><span \t\tstyle=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> work is the level of detail found in each piece, from teeth to feet and even hands, \t</span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Chris </strong><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">(Simpsons \t\tArtist)</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> has the ability to draw in a way that makes you question what a \t\t2D image can achieve, at times you feel like you could reach out and touch a real face.</span></p> <img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/04/210106_166915590033739_165754846816480_392657_6342844_o.jpg\" /> <p>Whatâ€™s refreshing too is <strong>Chris (Simpsons Artistâ€™s)</strong> disregard for post-modernism or irony, heâ€™s an \tartist thatâ€™s very much focused on the now, with his work tackling issues and dilemmas in a way that previously \thadnâ€™t been explored.</p> <p>When <strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist)</strong> recently got to 10,000 fans on Facebook yesterday, we simply had to \ttalk to the man. Below is the full, exclusive interview with the man that in less than a week has completely changed \tthe landscape of modern art.</p> <img src=\"https://localhost:8888/uploads/2011/04/simpsosncovr.jpg\" /> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> Not much is known about you <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheSimpsonsArt\">Chris (Simpsons \t\tArtist)</a>. Why donâ€™t you tell us a little bit about yourself?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> Well I am just a normal man who is 27 and Â¾. I like to think about life and \thow we got here and why we live in houses so close together and why we have to have big money to be happy people. I \tlike to sit in my garden to eat my food because itâ€™s less mess. I like to pretend birds can talk and they talk to me \tand I pretend that Iâ€™m a small and I can climb on their heads and they will show me where my brother is.</p> <p><strong>CITR: </strong>What got you into drawing Simpsons characters?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> I was 5 when the Simpsons went on the telly and I just used to watch it \tbecause I wasnâ€™t supposed to go outside. Once I watched the videos I would draw them on my paper and make them talk. </p> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> Iâ€™ve been having a go at making some art myself but Iâ€™m having trouble with the feet. Do you \thave any tips?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> There are ways around not having to draw feet if you find it a struggle. \tYou can just have people stand in front of boxes or make them have shoes to hide their feets.</p> <p><strong>CITR: </strong>Did you expect your page to get so popular?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> I didnâ€™t expect my page to be so popular because I didnâ€™t think so many \tpeople used the internet. But I am glad that people can see my detailed drawings from the hit U.S television \tprogramme â€˜The Simpsonsâ€™ because itâ€™s nice. Itâ€™s really humbling to have had 10,000 likes on my page in less than a \tweek.</p> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> In a years time, where would you like to see your work?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> In four years time I would like to see my pictures on flags that you can \tbuy or I can make my own television programme that would be on the television to watch at my house.</p> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> Do you have any plans to draw different characters, or even come up with your own?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> I draw pictures all of the day and I will eventually draw every Simpsons \tcharacter. I have a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle with all the characters on it and I look at it and choose them to draw \tthem. I like to draw my own characters and make stories about them fighting justice and carrying houses to tops of \thills to get away from people.</p> <p><strong>CITR: </strong>What do you want people to feel when they see your drawings?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> I want people to feel like they are happy. I donâ€™t like people feeling sad \tbecause itâ€™s more nice to feel happy or just a level mood in the day.</p> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> Whatâ€™s your favourite Simpsons Character?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> Good question. I really like Homer because he doesnâ€™t care about anything. \tI also like Apu because he has been shot.</p> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> Your work is pretty specialâ€¦has Matt Groening been in touch at all?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist): </strong>I can neither confirm nor deny whether any Simpsons producers or Dale \tRichmond from FOX have been in touch with me over the past one and a half days.</p> <p><strong>CITR: </strong>Describe a typical day in the life of Chris (Simpsons Artist)?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> â€¦. In the morning I get up and go outside and sit in my garden for an hour \tand have breakfast which is usually toast with a slice of ham on and butter on the top. I then go inside and sit in \tmy living room and listen to recordings I made of myself doing simpsons voices until I need the toilet. Then I go \tinto my bedroom and sit at my desk and draw detailed portraits of Simpsons characters for 5 hours and then I go \toutside to have my dinner which my mum brings me and leaves in the garden for me to eat. Then I go inside and write \tdown what I think happened to my brother. Then I go and look at the stars when it getâ€™s dark and think that my \tbrother is watching me. Then I usually get scared and go inside and think. Before bed I have a big bath and watch \tThe Simpsons on channel 4 and then I check to see if my bed is clean and if it is I sit on it and think about things \tand then I drink a ribena and then lie down and close my eyes and pretend to be underwater and then I think I go to \tsleep but I donâ€™t know cos I think Iâ€™m asleep.</p> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> Small amounts of people are being pretty mean about your work, how does this make you feel? </p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist): </strong>It doesnâ€™t mind me because I know that they just donâ€™t know who they are \tyet. When people are scared or worried about who they might be, they find other people who they think are vulnerable \tand pick on them to make themselves feel better. But I feel sorry for them because I know that they are only scared \tor insecure about their body or frightened that people wonâ€™t like who they really are.</p> <p><strong>CITR: </strong>Youâ€™re getting pretty famous because of your amazing artwork. How are you planning to stay \tdown to earth?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> I will probably just buy a new outfit and not make anyone suspicious.</p> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> With art this good there must be loads of people wanting to go out with you. Do you have a \tboyfriend or girlfriend?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist): </strong>I have a fiancÃ© I think, because I asked my girl friend to marry me at \tChristmas and she said it was fine.</p> <p><strong>CITR:</strong> Which other artists do you respect?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist):</strong> I really like the Simpsons artists because they are good drawers and I \treally like the man who drew my picture on holiday when I was small and I kept it in my pillow.</p> <p><strong>CITR: </strong>Finally. Iâ€™ve included a picture of me, Iâ€™m the guy on the right ðŸ™‚ could you do a drawing of \tme?</p> <p><strong>Chris (Simpsons Artist): </strong>Yes I can.</p> <img title=\"Joel CITR\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/04/Joel-CITR.jpg\" /> <p>Thanks Chris (Simpsons Artist)!
