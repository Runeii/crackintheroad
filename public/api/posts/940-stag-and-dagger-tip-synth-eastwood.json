As well as this fantastic experience, the music is also top quality, brought to you by Dublin’s finest, and as if that wasn’t enough, tickets for <strong>Stag and Dagger</strong> are avaliable for half price from the official Diesel store in Glasgow.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.staganddagger.com/\">Buy Tickets For Stag And Dagger</a></p>\n","slug":"940-stag-and-dagger-tip-synth-eastwood","category":"festivals","date":1274462869000,"wpid":940,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":624,"height":277,"src":"2011/06/syntheastwood2.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAEAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIH/8QAIRAAAgIBAgcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxIEBQYRISIjYdH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/8QAGBEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACA0H/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANHuZNVZbfbUudihXxZlDdvoyRx1uiDFadFyHQeI/YiDpax2IBP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587295252910,"updatedAt":1588403567517,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/syntheastwood2.jpg","categories":["festivals","music"]}
