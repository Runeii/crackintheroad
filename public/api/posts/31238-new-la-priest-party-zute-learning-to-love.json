The end effect is reminiscent of Adam Crisp’s recent work as <b>Clarence Clarity, </b>but with a clear and significant debt to last decade’s popular <em>new disco</em> strand of revivalist electro.</p>\n<p>As it unfurls across its 8 minute track time, practically flooding the listener with its host of touch points, <em>Party Zute / Learning to Love </em>proves itself gorgeous, expansive and genuinely exciting.</p>\n<p>If Oino was Sam’s announcement that he had returned – post-LOTP – and matured, <em>Party Zute/ Learning to Love</em> is his statement of intent as LA Priest.</p>\n<p>The debut album, Inji, hits the stores 29th June.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F203247161&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31238-new-la-priest-party-zute-learning-to-love","category":"music","date":1430400227000,"wpid":31238,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1500,"height":840,"src":"2015/04/watch-la-priest-oino.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAIRAAAQMEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBAMFERMSISMxksH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF/8QAGhEAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMAAjEEkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A3rnc5lyoQTIfS2x6m88aeGOw5zR0OfBH1RG/ScnsxvREQZ6XDLn2NBCztRP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587280339032,"updatedAt":1588403510071,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2015/04/watch-la-priest-oino.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
