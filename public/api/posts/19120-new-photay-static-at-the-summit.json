With 400 downloads (of what is a free album) being a criminally low number for such a fantastic record, check out the new track below, then grab the full <a href=\"https://photay.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LP here</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74955842\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19120-new-photay-static-at-the-summit","category":"mpfree","date":1358253630000,"wpid":19120,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":633,"src":"2013/01/481714_445775512125157_305005058_n-950x633.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUI/8QAHxAAAQMEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACIQMEBRESEzFh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDNGOzFzjqRp23VwcduDqYO/YPyVNMkyiIR/9k="},"createdAt":1587284183319,"updatedAt":1588443770661,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/01/481714_445775512125157_305005058_n-950x633.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
