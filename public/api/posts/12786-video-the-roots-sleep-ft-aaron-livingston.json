Aaron Livingston)","content":"<p>So I’ve <a href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/12065-new-hot-sugar-da-paperboy/\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned before</a> our boy <strong>Hot Sugar</strong>, and that he was working on the new album from <strong>The Roots</strong>. Well they’ve been posting tracks one by one in video form for a while, but it was the album opener I was waiting for – <em>Sleep</em>. <strong>Hot Sugar</strong> has masterfully produced this track to classy effect. It’s moody, dark, and lo-fi – not particularly things you’d usually associate with <strong>The Roots</strong>, but they’ve really been trying hard to top the bar they set for themselves in ’02 with <em>Phrenology</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Aaron Livingston</strong> – one half of <strong>Young Vipers</strong> with <strong>Hot Sugar</strong>, and also half of <strong>Icebird</strong> with <strong>RJD2</strong> – follows his <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/aaronearll/alright-then-4\" target=\"_blank\">Occupy Wall Street anthem</a> with a spot on this track. Both ghostly and soulful, the tension is beautiful. I haven’t heard every track from the new album, but from this opener it could be a return to form for <strong>The Roots</strong>. The video is as unglamorous and contemporary as you can get, and brilliantly edited. Let’s hope Jimmy Fallon’s house band will someday be a cherished household name – they do deserve it.</p>\n<p><em>Watch the video for Sleep below. The Roots’ new album Undun is due December 5th via Def Jam Records.</em></p>\n<p><center><object width=\"640\" height=\"360\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/pkaV2lkLIeE?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"640\" height=\"360\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/pkaV2lkLIeE?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object></center></p>\n","slug":"12786-video-the-roots-sleep-ft-aaron-livingston","category":"music","date":1321987217000,"wpid":12786,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":107,"src":"2011/11/undun-165x107.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQhBQYRMQcSMv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCnsPItpe7ftbtdevLcQRlXhKSGRuQUVnYDgno44zk9Vhk+pzpPIo31upgGIDe7Zz390pQf/9k="},"createdAt":1587293407251,"updatedAt":1588443777285,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/11/undun-165x107.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
