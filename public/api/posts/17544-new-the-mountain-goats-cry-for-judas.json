But you won’t plead. You’ll <em>enjoy </em>it.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F51661390&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17544-new-the-mountain-goats-cry-for-judas","category":"music","date":1343245743000,"wpid":17544,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284859677,"updatedAt":1588441775230,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2012/07/tmg-950x633.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
