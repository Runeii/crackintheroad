Oh, what a cliche.</p><p> But hold up a second, Parisian outfit<strong> Wolvs</strong> might not be as painfully upbeat as Daft Punk or Phoenix, but what they lack in smiles they more than make up for in sinister synth lines and a foreboding sense of self-inflicted fear. Debut track <em>Pieces</em> glides over a repeated Foals-esque jerky guitar line, whilst the synth line is not quite club banger, yet not quite indie classic, filling the murky void somewhere in the middle. As unsettlingly as it is enjoyable,<em> Pieces</em> is a startling ambitious creation.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F89827130\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21606-new-wolvs-pieces","category":"mpfree","date":1367362991000,"wpid":21606,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":95,"src":"2013/05/384425_189787381171903_1341246676_n-165x95.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIH/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCAAQRBQYHEiNRYf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEE/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEy/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDKOWGajZbpcud/Jq1TiUgR6iAGDEY+VSOQd2xSsDWDgRAHjHqlKquqH//Z"},"createdAt":1587283551425,"updatedAt":1588443768640,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/05/384425_189787381171903_1341246676_n-165x95.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
