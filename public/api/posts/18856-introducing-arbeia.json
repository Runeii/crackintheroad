They’re from South Shields, a town very close to the area I grew up in. Now this isn’t perhaps interesting to anyone who isn’t from the area, but to those who are, it’s actually rather poignant. South Shields is a wasteland; baron, empty and sad. Despite its proximity to the bright lights of Newcastle, people who grow up there find it very difficult to leave. <strong>Arbeia</strong>’s music however has already left; it’s vast in its undertakings and at times delicate in its findings. It’s music that isn’t made for one particular type of person or space, it fills a universal space that makes it such a joy to listen to. Sure it’s rough around the edges at times, but they’ve only been around for 3 months, time will hopefully smooth their sound out.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3113516\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18856-introducing-arbeia","category":"introducing","date":1356612723000,"wpid":18856,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":778,"src":"2012/12/arbeia.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAJAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgMH/8QAJBAAAQIDCAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMEAAIFBgcRITRBcrEiMVH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ACylk7OuG1PLVxWHSqqWBKVOMwkI+5DaDa13bYLKACpYCYjyCQPvcY5GN0rWgT4o9xVzqVeZ7hoQ5rSKG//Z"},"createdAt":1587284292938,"updatedAt":1588403534246,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/12/arbeia.jpg","categories":["introducing","music","newnews"]}
