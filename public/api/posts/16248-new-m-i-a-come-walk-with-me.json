Less of a tizz than I expected, but regardless, more than I few people got excited. Now I hate to piss on a perfectly harmless parade, but the new track, <strong><em>Come walk with me</em></strong>, hardly fills me with confidence in the upcoming album, <strong><em>Matangi</em></strong>. It all just sounds a bit awkward; the singing, the supposedly inspiring lyrics not to mention the pop sensibility that suddenly becomes disinterested and embarks on a little experimental adventure mid track.</p>\n<p><strong>M.I.A</strong>; if you’re reading this, which of course you’re not, this is what I want. Weird ass instruments, provocative streams of consciousness, socially conscious yet seemingly erratic flows and if you’re feeling particularly generous, with a sprinkle of rebellious thinking.</p>\n<p>Thnx xxxo</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXWs9P6ykHE\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16248-new-m-i-a-come-walk-with-me","category":"music","date":1335810296000,"wpid":16248,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587290899692,"updatedAt":1588441778658,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/04/mia-950x633.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
