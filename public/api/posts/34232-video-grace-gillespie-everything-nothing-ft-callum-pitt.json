Callum Pitt","content":"<p>Having spent much of last year touring as part of Pixx’s live band, London based <strong>Grace Gillespie</strong> is taking 2018 as her own.</p><p> With her debut demo, <em>Restoration</em>, receiving support from Newton Faulkner in Q Magazine, she’s now followed it up with her a live session of new track, <em>Everything (Nothing)</em>, calling in rising star Callum Pitt for assistance.</p>\n<p>The melodies here are just sublime, sure to bring about comparisons to Marika Hackman’s debut LP, or the dreamier, more ethereal moments of Sharon Van Etten. There’s a real pensive confidence to the musicianship at the core of this, as the track beautifully unfurls, aided by Pitt’s subtle backing vocals.
