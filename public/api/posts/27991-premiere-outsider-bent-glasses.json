Showing a maturity to his songwriting, the underlying sensibilities which personally made Puma Punk so enticing, are still there to be heard, yet merging his 80’s indebted sound with the likes of Washed Out and Neon Indian. The production is cleaner, the ambition is perhaps bolder, and ultimately, it’s an extremely promising step forward for Outside.</p>\n<p><em>Bent Glasses</em> is taken from The Last Guardian, out later in the year, an album taking it’s name from forever delayed Japanese video game.
