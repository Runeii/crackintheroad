Having wowed with a few tracks toward the tail end of last year, the Colorado duo are back with latest cut, <em>Nu Religion</em>. Another slice of woozy, Tame Impala inspired indie-rock, it’s wonderfully in your face and over the top. With the right team behind them, and a few more tracks to the quality of those already released, there will truly be no stopping Sunboy.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/160651188&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29288-new-sunboy-nu-religion","category":"music","date":1406552553000,"wpid":29288,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282023613,"updatedAt":1588441755596,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/068e44dea61da8a6241c6d4b91102c6c8911e62d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
