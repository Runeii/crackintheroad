With an added intensity, this latest effort rests upon a structure similar to the plot of it’s lyrics, with the references to the sea and the beach providing an ideal image to emphasize the wave like motion of the track, with each frenzy of emphatic vocals and splashes of guitar punctuated by periods of retreating calm.</p>\n<p>Melodically beautiful, with instrumentation that is as interesting as it is fun. This is going to be on repeat for quite some time.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F53368780&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17455-new-chateaux-everything-seems-better","category":"introducing","date":1342689727000,"wpid":17455,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284886178,"updatedAt":1588441775286,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2012/07/chateaux-everything-seems-better-165x142.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
