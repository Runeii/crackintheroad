Inspired by Congolese and South African records found in his dad’s record collection, Woodhead has managed to blend these influences with the modern production styles of the likes of Four Tet and Floating Points.</p>\n<p>‘Beautiful Rain’ has a brilliant simplicity that galvanizes a vibrant and colourful energy that exists throughout the track. Working around a series of strong percussive beats, the nuances in the production and the distribution of sounds allows for a different experience on every listen.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/234396950&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31880-new-jude-woodhead-beautiful-rain","category":"introducing","date":1449070577000,"wpid":31880,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":982,"height":800,"src":"2015/12/screen-shot-2015-12-02-at-16.27.32-982x800.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAICAIAAABPmPnhAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA7klEQVR4nAXBbU+CQAAA4NtaqKBHA7nj4AaHYvF2IFOISEIy0A84mm4utz70/39FzwNQNtBiUPNv8vnnf93T7ifsflf7m74+InsN4HMtR+3YLOflTSkuzu7iH+5u3tHgXbMSAK1CoB8TOce8IVGFtj0ur9amQ16lWClQDS7hYoKradAyXmrbM8yu+qbX/SZaeMBFpgFtOAtnbI+DSgyPUtIr8Qmz14i9gFRXFqIIH9EcpcgpNbbDyzfCCsvMHOKD03KayoL5MPZV2yOrgHiBwWOTx5QnpgeGUKrmo2Qk1PSpZlpj6w2jB4e1rl3Y1j/qvCXvbXmXqQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="},"createdAt":1587280225174,"updatedAt":1588403508359,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2015/12/screen-shot-2015-12-02-at-16.27.32-982x800.png","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
