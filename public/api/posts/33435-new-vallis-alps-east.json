{"id":"5e9bf8168fb2d30d7769c927","title":"New: Vallis Alps – East","content":"<p>It’s a testament to the strength of<strong> Vallis Alps’</strong> debut EP released back at the start of 2015, that aside from a single part-way through last year, it’s the only official material to their name.</p><p> Despite having a literal handful of tracks out in the open, the duo have managed to play to packed out crowds across Australia and the USA whilst remaining fiercely independent. Now with a date set for the release of their follow up EP, Fable, at the end of March, they’ve released lead single, <em>East</em>. Taking a more obviously pop direction, the production and songwriting at the core of the track remains immaculate, and is sure to become a festival favourite. Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/313294528&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33435-new-vallis-alps-east","category":"music","date":1490095881000,"wpid":33435,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2048,"height":2048,"src":"2017/03/17239815_1131917120265086_8258984277222132299_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgQH/8QAIxAAAgIBAwMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFISIRUXEGBxUx0f/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAGBEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRADH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AFFH1e0ySFpI1lCdTI3Bm8jIW9xqwJBuRdRtsx/My/X5H+Ni5tykAbf7HY4yqadRarCWp1iSikkxL28YoGNN1uqDq3f/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587279894729,"updatedAt":1588403501771,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/03/17239815_1131917120265086_8258984277222132299_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
