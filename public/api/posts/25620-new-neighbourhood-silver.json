Sold out tours, unique, ground-breaking appearances on prime-time TV shows and a debut album that broke the top 40 in the US, culminating in the announcement of a new album, titled  <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tags/000000\">#000000</a> & <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tags/FFFFFF\">#FFFFFF</a> (<strong><em>The Black And The White</em></strong>). Along with the news of a their sophomore LP, they also debuted new track, <em>Silver</em>, a real change in direction for the group. Maintaining much of the slick, R&B production values that initially shot them to fame, there’s an insatiable hunger and maturity to <em>Silver</em>; it’s a track that’s tearing down boundaries and placing limitless potential in their own hands. Check it out below, and catch them supporting <strong>The 1975</strong> at a bunch of UK shows next year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/124704409&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25620-new-neighbourhood-silver","category":"music","date":1387414626000,"wpid":25620,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282637926,"updatedAt":1588441760658,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/7880e6831c1b83030a4c261f46386b04003b0a97.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
