If this is the direction<strong> 502</strong> is going – hoping<strong> Fis-T</strong> is still with them, and following some great tunes from Finland’s<strong> Teeth</strong> and France’s <strong>Jay Weed</strong> – then I’m loving it. A consistent but very minimalist banger is on our hands…</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Room 502 below.</em></p>\n<p><center><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28532150&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28532150&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object></center></p>\n","slug":"12729-new-fis-t-room-502","category":"music","date":1321903132000,"wpid":12729,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/11/fis-t-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQGB//EACEQAAICAQQCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQRAAUSMSEiQVFh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A23db9ulvLV5J5G4yKxAtsocSylVHXrgYH5jI1X0YbMdKuk84eVY1V275MB5OfnRk2yhJI7yUaru2SzNEpJJ7J8aZRFRFRFCqowABgAfWiSP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293422634,"updatedAt":1588443777387,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/11/fis-t-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
