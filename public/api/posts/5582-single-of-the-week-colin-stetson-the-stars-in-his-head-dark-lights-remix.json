Our failure to review, or at the very least cover, Colin Stetson’s LP ‘New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges’ however was a rare moment when apologies and forgiveness were definitely in order.</p>\n<p>Because of our compulsive need to please however, we want to make it up to you in the name of a single of the week. Below is the video of my standout from the much-acclaimed LP. Enjoy, and have a great seven days.
