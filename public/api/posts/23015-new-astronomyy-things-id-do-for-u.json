New cut <em>Things</em> <em>I’d Do For U</em> is almost half the length, and is all the better for it. So it’s a sound that’s very much ‘in’ at this moment in time, part Frank Ocean, part Rhye. It’s guaranteed to be played on Radio 1 at some point in the near future, but don’t let that distract from how great a track this is.</p>\n<p><em>you got me thinking about the things that I do for you</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100728508\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23015-new-astronomyy-things-id-do-for-u","category":"music","date":1373645422000,"wpid":23015,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/07/48012_410527265730540_1190436177_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwb/xAAlEAACAQQBAQkAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAURBgchIjE1YXSSsbL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAREh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCl5tZY665zJNczmO9gupCiE6EigE6Hrs/dOmIcvibJj4tAhPxFAPMkV+oV0XUMVluSpI3o93tFPeC8jx3to/yKIKZrw//Z"},"createdAt":1587283281130,"updatedAt":1588403529201,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/07/48012_410527265730540_1190436177_n.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
