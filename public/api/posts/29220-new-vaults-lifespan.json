With a fantastically received set at Latitude this past weekend, and their debut single Cry No More still clocking up impressive Soundcloud stats, the three piece are ready to take 2015 by storm. Latest track, <em>Lifespan</em>, sees them returning to the winning formula of their debut, with the Ellie Goulding-esque vocals proving a particular highlight. Elegantly poised yet somewhere remarkably hard-hitting, check out <em>Lifespan</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/158774323&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29220-new-vaults-lifespan","category":"music","date":1405973203000,"wpid":29220,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282039429,"updatedAt":1588441755895,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ed27af8d264ee883f9db651426b6a9899d5fa51c.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
