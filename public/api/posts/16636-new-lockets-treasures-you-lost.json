Clinging to her every word in fragile anticipation and fantasizing that one day she’d slip her heart into your trembling hands seemed like the single possible scenario, blinded by youthful longing.</p><p> Years on, and every once in a while you happen to retrace the steps taken toward the place where you finally plucked up the courage to tell her how you felt. It’s deep down, it’s in your heart. This song is for her.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F46613172&show_artwork=true&oauth_token=1-16343-12721211-9694798aad8cfbe\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16636-new-lockets-treasures-you-lost","category":"mpfree","date":1337726324000,"wpid":16636,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587287444257,"updatedAt":1588441777631,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/61ce1d3665ad27a44119925aa64bd09d9858ae4b.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
