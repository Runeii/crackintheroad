Cue <strong>Muchuu</strong>, a band from the English countryside equally as dedicated to creating a distinct genre of music that they are desperate to disperse to the masses. ‘Synth-cuteness’ is the only word I could use, albeit made up, to describe the extraordinary music they create. This sibling duo have only been around a while, but they are performing at numerous festivals this year, including Bestival on the Isle of Wight. I have been listening to their début Album, <em>Adventure We Go</em>, non-stop for a week now and it is impossible to tire of. The vocalist, Milky, has such a charming voice, it sometimes becomes hard to listen to the lyrics independently as you become absorbed in the whole event the song produces. George is the musical genius in the band, who has been playing piano since the age of seven, who has the great ability to make music perfectly suited for Milky’s voice.</p>\n<p>Most of the songs on the album are very personal to the band, where Milky’s dreams come alive in the form of their songs, from the high tempo, upbeat <em>Songs in my Room </em>to the slightly slower but still wonderful <em>Dancing with a Ghost</em>. There is no song in the album that anyone would choose to skip, each song is so different and special that it is impossible to pick out any song that stands out above the rest.</p>\n<p>Overall, <em>Adventure We Go</em> is a magical album full of songs that will brighten anybody’s day and question why there are not more ‘cute’ bands about, its cheesy but we like it!</p>\n<p>Muchuu were good enough to answer a few of our questions:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: Being brought up in the English countryside, was creating music a way of relieving boredom to begin with or have you always had a passion for making music?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>George: I’ve always had a passion for music. I started playing piano when I was 7, and never stopped playing. But the first Muchuu</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>songs were birthed from times of boredom, this is very true. It’s boredom that was the spark to the Muchuu</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>fire. Let boredom be your spark, as I always say. Actually i’ve</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>never even said that before until right now.</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Milky: Yeah, for me it was just something fun to do during boring times, just messing around to start with, then we took it a bit more seriously…but never too serious! We’ve only been writing songs on and off for a couple of years and I’ve only be singing properly for about a year. I was very self-conscious to start with, George had to leave the room whilst I was singing on the demos! I don’t play an instrument either, so it’s all a bit random really. I always secretly wanted to be in a band though, a band like the Yeah Yeah</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Yeahs</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>or a singer like Siouxsie</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Sioux, but I’ll never be that cool!</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: To Milky: Where did your love of Japanese culture come from?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">‘</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>m not sure! I think it started when I was like 16 and I bought a book called ‘Fruits’ which is pictures of Tokyo street fashion and I just spent hours looking at the pictures and thinking everyone looked so awesome and different. Then I think I saw a few Studio Ghibli</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>films and fell in love with the whole crazy animation thing and it went from there really! It seems they have a slight obsession with ‘cute’ like I do too. I haven’t actually been though! I’ll give my true opinion once I’ve visited!</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: It appears you are a very experimental band, does this come from being naturally curious or was it a way of establishing your knowledge on music?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>George: I think we stick with a ‘why not’ mentality. Sometimes it works, sometimes it’s bad – but to conform would be boring!</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Milky: Experimenting is just fun really!</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: You obviously write your songs on a very personal level with most of your songs being inspired by dreams, do you take your song writing seriously or is it still ‘fun’ or both perhaps?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>George: If writing music ever becomes un-fun then I will most definitely stop doing it – but I doubt that will ever happen. Its always fun. We were created to create, and I can understand that when we start to write music.</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: Would you like to be considered as more than a ‘cute’ band, or are you happy with the label put on you?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Milky: It could be worse! This world needs a bit of cute right now I think. Although a lot of my actual lyrics aren’t that cute, I think that description comes more from the sounds we use and maybe my voice. I like to think our songs are magical!</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>George: I’d rather ‘cute’ than a lot of other labels! But the more songs we write, I think the less cute we become. We’re like cheese in terms of the more time goes by, the more mature we become. Beside Milky’s</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>lyrics are actually quite dark when you actually stop and look at them.</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: I saw a comment about you being ‘Enya</span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">meets the Ting Tings’, would you take this comparison in a positive or a negative light?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>George: Its the most confusing comparison ever. I would probably just ignore it.</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Milky: Although I did used to listen to Enya</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>when I was little, classic.</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: You are playing at the likes of Bestival</span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">this year, are you looking forward to the opportunity to broadcast your songs to a wide audience?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>George: Definitely. Gigs, especially festivals, are always unpredictable so you never know what it will end up being like – but as long as we reach a few more people with our music and they enjoy it, its all good.</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: What is your favourite</span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">gig you have performed at?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>George: My brain is like a sieve so I can’t remember a lot of them… My favourite</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>gig would probably be a gig we played at in Southampton a few months ago, ‘cos</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>when the last band played they had most of the audience on stage with them, including us. It was like some sort of West End musical finale, only with heavy electro dance music. Epic.

Haven’t done many of those, but I like them. And what George said – I agree. Fly Frankie Fly. Oh we got to go to Norway! Bit of travelling for a gig’s always nice!</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">CitR: Who are the best band you have either supported or been supported by?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Milky: We played a BBC Introducing gig with Florence and the Machine and Temper Trap.

But the only real cringey</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>moment was at our first ever gig when I kicked a big fake squirrel head into the audience as a strange finale, but it smacked a girl in the face.

I would probably have the power to stop time. But time wouldn’t stop for me obviously, otherwise that would be pointless. The universe would just stop forever.
