Delicate and timid, there’s a stellar songwriting capability expressed, verging into pop territory (<em>Twelve Oaks</em>), not mention the sublime, singalong chorus of <em>Ascend Soon</em>.</p>\n<p>For an artist with little to no online presence, no visible identity and only a handful of tracks to his name <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LeftRightArms\" target=\"_blank\">Left Right Arms</a></strong> makes one hell of an impact. Minimal yet intensely thought-provoking, it’s refreshing to hear a young artist that truly values substance over style. Check out the full EP below, and grab it at a pay-what-you-like deal.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3305944139/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18971-new-left-right-arms-a-sleep-ep","category":"mpfree","date":1357402589000,"wpid":18971,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284239051,"updatedAt":1587825882027,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
