There’s still a lot to look forward to when it comes to the world of <strong>Blake</strong> however. His new EP, <strong><em>Enough Thunder</em></strong>, is out next month on <strong>Atlas</strong> and this new cut is a promising representation of what’s to come. It’s a slow, drawn out and somber piece of music. It’s a piece of music that calls out for recognition and support, with <strong>Blake</strong>’s vocals sounding more and more like <strong>Jeff Buckley</strong> as times moves along. Stream the BBC rip below and check back to CITR next month for a review of the EP.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRSV6E_Lqpo\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"25\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11245-new-james-blake-not-long-enough","category":"music","date":1316011400000,"wpid":11245,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/jamesblake-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwYI/8QAIRAAAgEDBAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRBQYhUQciMUL/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8ALvEu6tZj1YrBNgj34VVA7+Ck6fdN7LNJIy27F2LE5HOTWdNsyOmq2QR2UGQZAOOqpJZpRK4ErgBj+jQf/9k="},"createdAt":1587293861294,"updatedAt":1588403548086,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/09/jamesblake-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
