The record features 4 tracks, which more often than not all centre on one or two  melodies. This, combined with the spacious production by friend of the site <strong>Erik David Hidde</strong>, gives the whole thing a weightless quality, it really does feel like the tracks could float away at any point.</p>\n<p>Away from the admittedly simple folk influenced arrangements, the lyrics and vocals offer a more emotionally meaty feast for the ears. The title track is a particular highlight. The lines <strong><em>“Love me like I’m going to die/ I’m never letting go/ no matter what you say to me/ I’ll always love you so”</em></strong>, aren’t exactly the post intricately poetic set of lines ever written. But it’s honest and eye wateringly raw.</p>\n<p>Stream our 2 highlights from the EP below and grab the full EP over at Chad’s <a href=\"https://chadhagans.bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp.</a></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1184445212/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1365122856/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11497-new-chad-hagans-remember-to-remember-me","category":"music","date":1316794939000,"wpid":11497,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":713,"height":501,"src":"2011/09/chad-hagans.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAIBAAAgEEAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQGEQUhIjFBkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAExQf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AnyHK+dyXipoHjS3LIdREqYPXjpR2p6P0isjHh1wqKGsrcsAATsHZ/aUqYo6//9k="},"createdAt":1587293772497,"updatedAt":1588403546975,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/09/chad-hagans.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
