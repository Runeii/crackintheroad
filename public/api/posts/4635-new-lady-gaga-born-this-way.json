Well, the most  important question is, is it any good?</p>\n<p>“Born This Way”  immediately marks it’s territory as more than your average throwaway  dance pop record “It doesn’t matter if you love him or capital H-I-M/  Just put your paws up/ Cause you were born this way, baby.” Intones gaga  in the spoken word intro before the record bursts into life as a great  big anthemic electro disco record. “Born This Way” is a record about  empowerment and embracing who you are, the lyrics urge the listener not  to feel any shame about their sexuality, religion, race or creed;<br />\n”I’m beautiful in my way/ Cause God makes no mistakes/ I’m on the right track, baby/ I was born this way.”</p>\n<p>“Born  This Way” is pop music as polemic and  an indication of Gaga using her  iconic status to spread her own message and unique philosophy. What  could sound like a hectoring self help lecture in the hands of any other  artist is made incredibly exciting by Gaga’s sheer force of personality  and the insidiousness of the melody and hooks.</p>\n<p>Throughout the  single Gaga’s influences are made clear. The title is influenced by 1975  disco classic and pop’s first openly gay record “I Was Born This Way”  by Valentino. The song itself, whether intentionally or by accident,  sounds startlingly like late eighties Madonna’s hi-NRG gem “Express  Yourself” which of course is entirely a good thing and provides a sense  of continuity between pop’s most iconic female provocateurs.</p>\n<p>“Born  This Way” perhaps does not live up to the mountainous hype but how  could it? It is still a fantastic comeback and Gaga is now much more  than a mere pop singer. “Born This Way” is the record that can match her  new exalted status.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"349\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/Z4a8QtvOkBQ?fs=1&hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/Z4a8QtvOkBQ?fs=1&hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n","slug":"4635-new-lady-gaga-born-this-way","category":"music","date":1297899859000,"wpid":4635,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2000,"height":1329,"src":"2011/02/lady_gaga.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAhEAACAgEEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEAAYREiETFCJRYf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDERIh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCcakvaZsR0TZpwMIK6RrH6/jLhYI24l0+XZdjyO53H1koNeqxLLcRFPYVkYlfwnbGMKtYQs5bPp//Z"},"createdAt":1587294738678,"updatedAt":1588403560415,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d33","old_image":"2011/02/lady_gaga.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
