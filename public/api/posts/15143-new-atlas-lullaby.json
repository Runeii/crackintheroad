As with her two debut tracks, <em>Lullaby</em> showcases <strong>ATLAS’s</strong> vocals to exalted effect, as she flirts between spoken word and silky smooth chorus parts; “Your time is nigh, soon you will find, Another heart to crucify”.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36797712&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15143-new-atlas-lullaby","category":"mpfree","date":1329521750000,"wpid":15143,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292808487,"updatedAt":1588441781338,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/b6229f7dd34d34819c92f6d907dfaff59114e5b4.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
