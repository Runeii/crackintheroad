Whether it be the solemnly haunting clarinet or the tribal-esque swing of <em>Spiced Rum</em>, <strong>James Broughton</strong> clearly understands the complexity yet benefit of keeping his music grounded.</p>\n<p>His debut EP <em><strong>Quests</strong></em> is a stimulating listen, flexing it’s inner beauty throughout it’s six track run length. It reminds me of driving down a street of high rise buildings, and catching glimpses of other paths of life down the various intersections that flash by, all too fleeting yet memorable. Stream my personal favourite, <em>Attacked By Panthers</em> below, and head over to the <strong>Housewarming Records</strong> <a href=\"https://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/album/quests\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> for a full download.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=218540905/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/track/attacked-by-panthers\">Attacked by Panthers by J Biscuits</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13801-introducing-j-biscuits","category":"introducing","date":1326471219000,"wpid":13801,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1845037196,"height":132,"src":"2012/01/1845037196-1-165x132.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAIxAAAQMDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBAMFBiExBxETIiVCYf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME/8QAHREAAQMFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFERIxkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ar4dXzIb9Uj3Kfj0mfBluBMhtIOBLefsdtVpqtW4dR/iJLNT2gbfERLHlOKTqeCoH7WxHOyM5V3wV/9k="},"createdAt":1587293105225,"updatedAt":1588443776517,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/01/1845037196-1-165x132.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
