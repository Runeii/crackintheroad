Having already donated two tracks as free downloads, the beautiful “I’m Not Afraid To Wait For You” and the more upbeat “Alone at Sea”, there’s a feeling that Two Bicycles has a real belief in the quality of their music, and quite rightly so. “Moon Colours” is a placid affair, reverb laden guitar chords shimmer gracefully; an accomplished track, showing that The Ocean has the potential to be a truly fantastic record.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stadiumsandshrines.com/?p=3058\">Download Moon Colours</a></p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_11244048.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"5200-new-two-bicycles-moon-colours","category":"music","date":1299788378000,"wpid":5200,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/03/bycycle-165x165.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAKCAYAAACNMs+9AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA4ElEQVR4nDWQuwqFQAxE/UKvbwsVH/hA0UJEBQsFwcbKxkqw8EfnkoEtwm42J5PJanEcw7Ishud5CIIA0zQhTVP4vg/HcVjTbNuGaZr4/X6Qu4D3faMoCr4LZBgGNJXouk7FKIoISC6ANBMUSBUkRFlONUUggsqDdLZtizzP6UspqgbNdV1Cy7LgeR5UVUVwHEf6VTCXCcMQ13XhfV90XcdFvu/DMAwExbsml7IssW0bVed5RtM0PJMkoboER6/rin3fOarve8jfyvZSkyBY1zXO88RxHFTOsoyfLZaUmsB/6snScMpFteYAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"createdAt":1587294673215,"updatedAt":1588403559473,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/03/bycycle-165x165.png","categories":["music","reviews"]}
