His last record the CMYK EP was a perfect example of this; sparse yet dramatically groove filled, the EP was pretty much loved by anyone who listened to it.</p>\n<p>Blake’s latest record, the Klavierwerke EP takes these sounds and runs with them in a truly inspirational and brave new direction.  What makes the record happens not to be the title tune at all, since its release last week “I Only Know (What I Know Now)” has been receiving all the attention and its not hard to hear why. Made using only 6 sounds; a bass drum, the fragment of a cymbal, one somber piano chord, and a couple of voices, the tune is utterly wonderful in its simplicity and utterly inspiring in its found complexity. So here it is, enjoy.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F5612712&secret_token=s-yy3fs&width=460&color=3b5998&height=98&show_artwork=false\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F5612712&secret_token=s-yy3fs&width=460&color=3b5998&height=98&show_artwork=false\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object><span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/anoraklondon/03-i-only-know-what-i-know-now\">I Only Know What I Know Now- James Blake</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/anoraklondon\">Anorak London</a></span></p>\n","slug":"3087-single-of-the-week-james-blake-i-only-know-what-i-know-now","category":"music","date":1286476186000,"wpid":3087,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2010/10/jamesblake-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwX/xAAlEAACAgECBAcAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAhBQYTMQcSFCIyQ1H/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AoeK5WKxy9bTiNmk0V6JHlimYLEhbdmUHcHtvnvpB9bC3uV1KncEMMY0Tcbd5Or1GZsWXx5jns22hG5eti3OBan+bfYf3Qf/Z"},"createdAt":1587294942325,"updatedAt":1588403563286,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2010/10/jamesblake-165x165.jpg","categories":["music"]}
