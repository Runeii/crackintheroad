Yesterday they made the first song <em>Lights </em>available to download for free from their official website, and whilst they are not covering any new ground or reinventing themselves, it is a welcome return from the New York band. A slow burning opening gives way to an<strong> Interpol</strong> sound much coveted on 2007’s <strong>Our Love To Admire, </strong>although finds <strong>Paul Banks </strong>in a darker, more isolated place, as he atones <em>“don’t turn away, and lead me to plead in this hole of a place”. </em>You can download <em>Lights </em>in exchange for your email address from the link below, let us know what you think of it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.interpolnyc.com/lights.html\">Download From Official Site</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","slug":"497-interpol","category":"music","date":1272516720000,"wpid":497,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":640,"height":427,"src":"2011/06/interpol_titp05_12.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAJBAAAgEDAwMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQGBRESExUhIiNBYYH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBP/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AlbP7nEdWzXTpSswtHj7eEhVG4llVQH8kKY23O/q3A+xWUvkOLl2Nxo1zLOT7knVA5N8n9NKVPgyl/9k="},"createdAt":1587295320215,"updatedAt":1588403568524,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/interpol_titp05_12.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
