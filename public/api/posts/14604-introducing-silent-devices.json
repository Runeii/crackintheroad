There’s David Attenborough, I suppose, and the guy who played Boba Fett), but after stumbling upon these guys at London’s monthly <a href=\"https://www.communionmusic.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Communion</a> a while back, I couldn’t help but fall in love. Mixing epic post-rock melodies with some fantastic vocals and just a dash of ambience, these guys really manage to make good their claim that they are a band made for festival main stages – and it probably helps that their live act is absolutely up to scratch too.</p>\n<p><strong>Silent Devices </strong>have a double-A single out next month, <em>Una</em>/<em>Moire</em>, both of which can be found on their Soundcloud page. But the pinnacle of their unfortunately sparse output is <em>Warm Blood</em>, a track that brings together the best of both post-rock and indie pop. It sounds like an odd combination, but it really, really works.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F3447442&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"www.facebook.com/silentdevices\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Silent Device</strong>‘s Facebook</a> </p>\n","slug":"14604-introducing-silent-devices","category":"introducing","date":1328526857000,"wpid":14604,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":720,"height":405,"src":"2012/02/394349_10150587865833169_25659858168_10923917_1113672930_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABQYhMUFx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAxFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDCpm31kviuljyYBaVCQ6zUekh9ahaXFnySD6+990IrGMWvBqvcZ//Z"},"createdAt":1587292941620,"updatedAt":1588403542356,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d16","old_image":"2012/02/394349_10150587865833169_25659858168_10923917_1113672930_n.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
