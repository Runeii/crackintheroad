Every gaping crotch, exposed undergarment and half-pulled-off hockey sock was as carefully constructed on the inside as it was on the outside.</p>\n<p>But still, everything seems unfinished – or finished then unfinished again. It’s all about getting ready to go out, getting socks trapped in doors, feeling ugly, hating the pretense of it all, deciding you don’t really give a shit about looking nice anyway and being destructive to counteract the whole stupid ordeal. It’s teen angst and questioning sexuality. It’s rebellion. It’s Kevin and Perry Go Large.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/09/Usami-redblue.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-24284\" alt=\"Usami red&blue\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-redblue.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-redblue.jpg 620w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-redblue-178x300.jpg 178w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-redblue-606x1024.jpg 606w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-redblue-30x50.jpg 30w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-catwalk.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-24285\" alt=\"Usami catwalk\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-catwalk.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-catwalk.jpg 550w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-catwalk-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-catwalk-300x300.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-catwalk-100x100.jpg 100w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/Usami-catwalk-50x50.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Quite frankly, I loved everything about it.
