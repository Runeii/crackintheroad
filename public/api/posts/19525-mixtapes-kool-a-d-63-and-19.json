Following Heems announcing dates for his UK tour (for details, check <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/19462-news-first-uk-solo-show-for-heems-since-das-racist-breakup/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), this has been a fantastic week for fans of the recently disbanded group. There are a host of guests across the new mixtapes, including Spank Rock, Lakutis, Meyhem Lauren and Busdriver, and some quality producers, such as Mike Finito, SKYWLKR, Amaze 88, Kool A.D. himself and, most interestingly of all, a beat the late Ad-Rock made for Das Racist, but the group never got round to using.</p>\n<p>You can head over to Kool A.D.’s bandcamp and name your price to download the albums. Find ’19’ <a href=\"https://koolad.bandcamp.com/album/19\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and ’63’ <a href=\"https://koolad.bandcamp.com/album/63\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The rapper also released a video from ’19’ about a week ago, which you can watch below. Damn, it’s been a good day.</p>\n<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4DvsihB6HA</p>\n","slug":"19525-mixtapes-kool-a-d-63-and-19","category":"newmixtapes","date":1360264961000,"wpid":19525,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284027966,"updatedAt":1588441770866,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/9e96185c97a182fed3ae908b280e6ea5de418ddc.jpg","categories":["newmixtapes","mixtapes","music"]}
