This new disco heavy cut is a dramatic and sensual little treat, soulful samples, clashes, stomps, the kitchen sink; you name it. Shit like this is made for the dance-floor, and I’m sat in my smoke filled bedroom. Shame.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F78554556\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19727-new-avalon-emerson-caroline","category":"music","date":1360695632000,"wpid":19727,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":127,"src":"2013/02/avalon-165x127.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMI/8QAHhAAAAcAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFEQYIFWH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ar19vfWv+P1kJK2nK+NKfnOOlpPGrEklB79JR6NLgAD//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283981320,"updatedAt":1588443769911,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/02/avalon-165x127.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
