Featuring lines such as “<em>Stefani, you suck, I know you’re selling twenty million / Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg</em>” and “<em>You’re looking like a man, you’re talking like a baby / How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial, crazy?</em>“, it’s no coincidence that this old demo has ‘leaked’ online ahead of <strong>Gaga’s</strong> new release, which is rumoured to feature <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong>… I guess they kissed and made up.</p>\n<p>“Remember when the streets used to be dangerous and we were born bad” HA. Also, if you want a good laugh, check out Lady Gaga and Lana fans bickering in the Youtube comments.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/fmaC8n_eP9Q\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23282-new-lana-del-rey-so-legit","category":"music","date":1374662430000,"wpid":23282,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283248037,"updatedAt":1588441764148,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2736a6e2cb43c3a4db793c65c8e.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
