In short, it’s his most assured and focused work to date, with the tracks structure at times flawless, the track’s ending builds to something utterly breathless, an adjective I hadn’t previously associated with <strong>SOHN</strong>’s work.</p>\n<p>Hit play and check <strong>SOHN</strong>’s upcoming live dates below: oh shit, <strong>Crack in the Road</strong> are putting him on at their SXSW showcase??!!
