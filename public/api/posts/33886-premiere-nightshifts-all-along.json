Recorded after a move downtown and “before I had any furniture; just sitting on the floor with my guitar, mics, and synths.”, it’s this honesty that really sets it aside from many contemporaries; it’s a love song at it’s core and that really shines through.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/336356259&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33886-premiere-nightshifts-all-along","category":"music","date":1504099230000,"wpid":33886,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":3089,"height":2048,"src":"2017/08/nightshifts-press-1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAIhAAAQMDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQFIQYSEyIkQVGR/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABoRAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMREpH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM9oO4261VDJa6OZ5dHKAWHyRtGPqjqK2388naNPUc59oiBodLBrmSgaPJ//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587279818365,"updatedAt":1588403499065,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/08/nightshifts-press-1.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
