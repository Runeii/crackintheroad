It’s been a pretty sublime 12 months for <strong>Thomas Crystal</strong> and <strong>Benjamin Louisiana</strong>, having seen their fanbase expand rapidly, largely due to the release of their debut album proper <strong><em>Aurora Lies</em></strong> a few months back. The two piece have also spent much time perfecting their live performance and crafting fitting music videos to accompany their ‘chillwave’ influenced tracks.</p>\n<p><em>Dirty Dreams</em> picks up on the instrumental work of Philadelphia contemporary <strong>Dylan Sieh</strong> aka <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tours\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tours</strong></a>, and expands the track from there. With their wistful vocals and glistening synths, <strong>Work Drugs</strong> transform <em>Dirty Dreams</em> into one of their finest efforts to date, hopefully indicating that they aren’t about to let the quality of their music slip. Listen to <em>Dirty Dreams</em> below, and grab it as a free download if you wish.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29929005\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29929005\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/work-drugs/dirty-dreams\">Dirty Dreams</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/work-drugs\">Work Drugs</a></span></p>\n","slug":"13013-mpfree-work-drugs-dirty-dreams","category":"mpfree","date":1323280723000,"wpid":13013,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/12/332973_304939226194620_162709987084212_1042428_573449929_o-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGB//EACMQAAIBAwEJAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECBAADEQYFEiEjMUFRYdH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABv/EABoRAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEABECA0P/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALQaasvKxIWUiuxJKXGGATRzaD2UWO7PnY7c1vtaJEVTEyVBOB1HoUnucHbHk1INP7BVQEFcuYn/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293307700,"updatedAt":1588443776878,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/12/332973_304939226194620_162709987084212_1042428_573449929_o-165x165.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
