That’s why it was so exciting last night when <strong>Earl</strong> related Twitter and Tumblr accounts surfaced on the web, the first post on the Twitter account was, “nigga need followers. give me 50,000 and i’ll release this shit for everybody.”</p>\n<p>50k came, we waited, then sure enough a link to <strong>Earl</strong>‘s new website was posted complete with brand new track ‘Home’. Now not that I’m bitter or anything, but I stayed up till 4am for this, and subsequently I’m really fucking tired as I write this; but I find the new track incredibly underwhelming.</p>\n<p>But what do you think?
