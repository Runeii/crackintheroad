The band’s stunning level of progression and development is mirrored in their latest single ‘<strong>Koala</strong>‘, which stands as a shining example of how to make an incredibly enjoyable and listenable pop song without sacrificing any musical integrity. The transcendental percussion that <strong>Vinyl Jacket </strong>fans have come to love remains, however the band have further refined their orchestration of vocals, guitars and euphoric synths without sacrificing any of the fun that makes <strong>Vinyl Jacket</strong> tracks truly special.
