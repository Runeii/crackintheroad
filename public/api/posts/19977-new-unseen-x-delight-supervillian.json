{"id":"5e9c07c9774c2610387e4fae","artists":["5e9b695d7a1236eccfeb26b3"],"title":"New: Unseen x Delight – SuperVillian","content":"<p>The Unseen x Delight track ‘Supervillian’ is a straight-up banger.</p><p> The track does nothing that hasn’t been done before, but the old school style beat channels the spirit of the kind of traditional hip-hop that I hope never goes out of style. It’s sample heavy, with lofty sounding strings and turntable scratches, the kind of beat that seems to beg your body to take action. Unseen does a decent job spitting over the track, his husky voice, while not being particularly nimble, has enough of an edge to add a bit of grit to proceedings.</p>\n<p>The mixtape this cut comes from, the <em>Past Present Perspective LP, </em>isn’t quite as impressive as the track, but it is probably worth a spin if you like the song. You can stream and download ‘SuperVillain’ below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4983404/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19977-new-unseen-x-delight-supervillian","category":"newmpfree","date":1361438523000,"wpid":19977,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283913424,"updatedAt":1587825877888,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","categories":["newmpfree","new","music","newnews"]}
