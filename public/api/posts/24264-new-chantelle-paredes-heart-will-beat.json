Paredes’s angelic, soothing vocals float mystically over a tenderly played pipe organ, as the song builds to it’s layered crescendo. Check out <em>Your Heart Will Beat You</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F110070137\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24264-new-chantelle-paredes-heart-will-beat","category":"music","date":1379345858000,"wpid":24264,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282971007,"updatedAt":1588441762532,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/73e57d0fb31cd472a26d4f646787be2baf4bb78c.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
