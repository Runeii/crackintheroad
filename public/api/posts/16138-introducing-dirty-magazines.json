Comprised of <strong>Wade</strong> on guitar and<strong> Tiffany</strong> on vocals, not only do <strong>Dirty Magazines</strong> have one of the best band names around, their music is bloody brilliant. Their two debut tracks are raw, slightly dirty sounding pop tunes, bubbling with charisma and personality. <em>Da Doo Run Runaway</em> has all the makings of a ‘blog-hit’ and <em>No Colder/No Wiser</em> shows a more progressive side to their sound, slick and languid surf pop at it’s utmost adorable. Oh, and if that wasn’t enough, how awesome is the artwork? Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"150\" height=\"450\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2070706178/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://dirtymagazines.bandcamp.com/album/online-tracks\">Online Tracks by Dirty Magazines</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16138-introducing-dirty-magazines","category":"introducing","date":1335136147000,"wpid":16138,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":181,"src":"2012/04/700738322-1-165x181.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAALAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgIE/8QAIRAAAgICAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQQSBSEABhRBUXH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBP/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBg3sbRex8vDz+a3HPhmsMKSEeP6cJ3uxJW6sVddjpvi8qZ8aGX4WSd0DWuoBsX1Zuv75eRBC+ZhzPFG0q7BXKAsBqegfNGx/T4quR//9k="},"createdAt":1587292526158,"updatedAt":1588443774577,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/04/700738322-1-165x181.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
