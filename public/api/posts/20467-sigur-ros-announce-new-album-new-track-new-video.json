Coming soon after the band’s first lineup change since 1999, they’ve somehow managed to convert a smaller number of instrumentalists in to a more powerful, stark, clear cut sound.</p>\n<p>For all <em>Valtari’s</em> successes, there was the hint that this was the sound of a band beginning to rest on their laurels slightly – with few surprises during the course of the record. If this followup is to continue with the sound of <em>Brennisteinn</em> – as other tracks previewed live would suggest – then this promises to be a treat.</p>\n<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc6zXSdYXm8#!</p>\n","slug":"20467-sigur-ros-announce-new-album-new-track-new-video","category":"music","date":1363952158000,"wpid":20467,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283754169,"updatedAt":1588441768232,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"generated/a59d8eccbfa73e26b6be484cc4b02951bbb40bb3.jpg","categories":["music","news","new"]}
