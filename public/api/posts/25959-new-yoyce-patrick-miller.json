YOYCE nail irresistible summer washed tones, just crying out for the hot months to be upon us. Trust me, it would be a sin not to press play and enjoy this little diamond right now.</p>\n<p><strong>YOYCE</strong>‘s <strong>Exclusive Preview One</strong> two track EP is available now for free download <a href=\"https://yoyce.bandcamp.com/\">over here</a>.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128983042″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"25959-new-yoyce-patrick-miller","category":"music","date":1389643788000,"wpid":25959,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1200,"height":799,"src":"2014/01/yoyce.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAgIDAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEBQYHIUGx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAxEh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwC/9gSdDo8YxcLbm0JELO00bBSaF1+5lmv5LvNBG0sW3JIVBZzu0WNfJqvvGMOrxiTXD//Z"},"createdAt":1587282568826,"updatedAt":1588403521748,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d44","old_image":"2014/01/yoyce.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
