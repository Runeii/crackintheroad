Recent offering, <em>Hide and Seek</em>, is a sleek, almost BANKS-esque number, but with far more kick to it. Elsewhere there’s the brooding instrumental<em> Limitation</em> alongside a couple of collaborations (some of which have seemingly disappeared). Check out Hide and Seek and The Line below, as well as a couple more of at her <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/kyemunroe\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>. Also keep up with her awesome <a href=\"https://kyemunroe.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a>, where fans have likened her to everyone from Megan Fox to Jacquelyn Jablonski.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/159284033&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/136593964&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/81174198&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29205-introducing-kye-munroe","category":"music","date":1405968372000,"wpid":29205,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282040624,"updatedAt":1587825846628,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","new"]}
