Adelaide five piece<strong> East End Villains</strong> serve as a timely reminder of the (hopefully) glorious weather to come, with their upbeat, quirky beach pop. With only three tracks available so far, it’s clear that the group are still very much at grassroots level, yet as we know all too well, that by no means prevents them creating fantastically enjoyable music.</p>\n<p><strong>They Don’t Deceive Me</strong> is a wonderfully charming number, complete with jangly guitar lines and slick vocal harmonies, whereas <em>Lucy</em> is a more reserved affair, presumable an ode to a former lover. Of the trio of tracks, it’s the final outing entitled<em> Ocean</em> that demonstrates the most potential, with it’s <strong>Foals</strong>-esque brooding atmosphere and excitable vocals. Check out all three tracks below. and grab a free download if you fancy.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"355\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 355px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3156324437/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://eastendvillains.bandcamp.com/album/east-end-villains\">East End Villains by East End Villains</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15966-introducing-east-end-villains","category":"introducing","date":1333632121000,"wpid":15966,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292577785,"updatedAt":1587825898473,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
