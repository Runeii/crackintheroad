So, what happens when an artist purposefully goes out of their way to not only change their sound, but to replicate that of another musician? Well, in the case of LA’s <strong>TV Girl</strong>, who set themselves the goal of writing and recording a <strong>Youth Lagoon</strong> ‘style ditty’, entitled<em> Diet-Coke</em>, and you know what, it isn’t half bad.</p>\n<p>So it’s feels slightly like a watered down (or sugar free if you must ha ha ha) version of Mr <strong>Powers</strong>, awash with reverb drenched vocals and even a hopelessly addictive hook, however given that mimicking his sound was their intention, they’ve done a bloody good job of it.
