Earlier today the trio made a video available for one of the album’s highlights; the atmospheric, ecstasy trip <em>Surface</em>. The video echoes the eerily disturbed feeling of the track, showing what appears to be somewhere between an overtly sexualised fight and a violently psychotic party. Check out the video for <em>Surface</em> below, directed by <a href=\"malcolmelijah.com\" target=\"_blank\">Malcom Elijah</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/31354239?color=000000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/31354239\">Pure X – “Surface”</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/malcolmelijah\">Malcolm Elijah</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n","slug":"12211-video-pure-x-surface12211","category":"music","date":1320165325000,"wpid":12211,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293584662,"updatedAt":1588441787668,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/d356e30b319286a2b3f60d85cbe2036c71b60d08.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
