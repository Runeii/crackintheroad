Jess Morgan, a twenty one year old from Walthamstow, feels like she should be guesting on a Nelly track, with her super slick delivery, girl power agenda and uber soulful vocals.

Check out <em>Take It Back</em> below, alongside previous single <em>Struck Out</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F99984392\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F96259221\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23755-new-spark-take-it-back","category":"music","date":1376059436000,"wpid":23755,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283119111,"updatedAt":1588441763485,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/6ece5394c7e5bf92ba4538c5d8f89c4924942df3.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
