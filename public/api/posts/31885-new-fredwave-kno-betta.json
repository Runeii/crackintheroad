Directed by Marco Grey, the video touches upon very real issues that exist for young people growing up in London, while intertwining Fredwave’s own worlds of love and regret, leaving the finished product as a must watch from beginning to end.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YaCmtDed90\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31885-new-fredwave-kno-betta","category":"introducing","date":1449491058000,"wpid":31885,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1280,"height":714,"src":"2015/12/screen-shot-2015-12-07-at-13.08.48-1280x714.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAr0lEQVR4nAXBTQ+CIBgA4BcU8wMpDSlzzlopIsrQtVYdO7RWh05d+h/9/54HVNNa3bM4BgCMEMHYdYmW0qiu2degW2W1JoQAQM7oc2hULuT+cDSmkxLGwYy9RghhhMZq871O974+W3OZ7HHoodwUySIBhwgaPvTu9769xpZzIWs5KAUAyCU+ZalDvNO2/JzMaimiuaCM86wAjB1vFvpB7HgBjSI/CCnL1nm1SFeZKP5gOhMBLY+NCAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="},"createdAt":1587280224076,"updatedAt":1588403508333,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2015/12/screen-shot-2015-12-07-at-13.08.48-1280x714.png","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews","videos"]}
