With the combined length of the two tracks coming in at little over four minutes, they appear to be aiming to capture the essence of 60s inspired indie pop.</p>\n<p>After taking a listen to<em> Do You Wanna</em>; the only song made previous available by the group, I was somewhat underwhelmed. Their blend of <em>Pet Sounds</em> pop with chillwave influenced guitars sounded all too familiar, however this new single from<strong> The Vaccines </strong>is a vast improvement.<em> Wreckin’ Bar</em> is a<strong> Ramones</strong> inspired beauty, coming in at under a minute and a half; fresh, exciting and a fantastic introduction to a band with a bright future. Whereas<em> Blow It Up</em> is a more atmospheric affair, less out there rock, more melodic pop harmonies, not too far from the sound recently re-pioneered by <strong>The Drums</strong>. Watch out 2011, looks like <strong>The Vaccines </strong>are set to dominate the coming year.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://thevaccines.co.uk/\">The Vaccines Official Site</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_11244048.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"3119-single-of-the-week-the-vaccines","category":"music","date":1286870347000,"wpid":3119,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":720,"height":720,"src":"2011/06/the-vaccines2.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587294935357,"updatedAt":1588403563180,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/the-vaccines2.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
