To see that they are due to perform <strong>Rockness</strong> for the first time on the Main Stage on Sunday, albeit quite early in the day, on is a pleasant surprise and I believe seeing this performance will be an ideal way to get rid of the remnants of Saturday’s hangover. With two albums and and three EPs under their belts already, they have quite a collection songs to choose from for their set. My hope is they play singles <em>And She Would Darken the Memory </em>and <em>The Room</em> which are two great songs, ideal for hopefully a sunny Sunday on the picturesque banks of Loch Ness.</p>\n<p>They have been in the studio earlier on this year and hope to have a third album out by the end of 2011 so if the fans are lucky they may be able to sample some of <strong>The Twilight Sad</strong>‘s new material, which has been promised as entirely different from their other releases which shows the passion and ambition this band possesses and from what I can gather, this band will be here for years to come and are well worth seeing at this years <strong>Rockness. </strong></p>\n","slug":"8419-rockness-tip-the-twilight-sad","category":"music","date":1307561030000,"wpid":8419,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/06/the+twilight+sad+twilight+sad-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQMI/8QAIhAAAgEDBAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRBRITMQZBISJx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM7pv0vSTHdWcTQ34JinZfumPhsDv30f0VZtAikYyQx3XEx3Jkej1RvkMjy3oaR2duMDLHJwKNAGOhVW4P/Z"},"createdAt":1587294306710,"updatedAt":1588403554402,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d07","old_image":"2011/06/the+twilight+sad+twilight+sad-165x165.jpg","categories":["music"]}
