Beyonce)","content":"<p>This probably won’t come as a surprise to anyone who has been following <strong>BOOTS’</strong> career with the same scrutiny as we have, given his previous work with Queen B, it was only a matter of time before BOOTS brought Beyonce in onto a track of his own.</p><p> <em>Dreams</em>, the last song on his debut mixtape, features vocals from Beyonce, as well as his own, alongside his now world-renowned slick, R&B production. Check out <em>Dreams</em> below, as well as a message from BOOTS underneath that, about the significance, and aims behind releasing the song.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/145774572&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>A while back I promised myself that if I ever had the opportunity to help others, or give back in some way, I would seize it.</p>\n<p>A friend recently told me about a non-profit organization called “Day One” here in NYC. In their words, “Day One is the only organization in New York City solely devoted to the issue of teen dating violence.”</p>\n<p>I feel that protecting women from these horrible and unthinkable acts should take precedence in our society. I feel passionate about this because if more women knew that safe places existed from the turmoil they experience, it could possibly prevent these situations from occurring or reoccurring.</p>\n<p>Every cent made from this song will go directly to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DayOneNY\" data-hovercard=\"/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=216414131710645&extragetparams=%7B%22directed_target_id%22%3A0%7D\">Day One</a></p>\n<p>It’s hard to put into words how thankful I am for everything and everyone who helped get this together. I’ve experienced a lot in my life. Good and bad. But through it all, I’m certain every one of those things had to happen to get me right where I am today. I feel very fortunate for that. Thanks for all of your love and support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fdayone.org%2F&h=1AQENb-XS&enc=AZPqJGUDavRJpbTOuv_0cYtGIALmnz2fiP7101VTOX1OddKHb1Lka8EtRq5DIHgIVqGTsYdRxD69BKE8QsxKP2qly3PwwOY-bLW8XCSc4dU7JnOrg8486orqtTv9VQM1pThOg-VpFe5SHfLzIRiTRHC4&s=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\">https://dayone.org/</a></p>\n","slug":"28031-new-boots-dreams-feat-beyonce","category":"music","date":1398194774000,"wpid":28031,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282186457,"updatedAt":1588441758128,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/knowles-beyonc-508490b420589.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
