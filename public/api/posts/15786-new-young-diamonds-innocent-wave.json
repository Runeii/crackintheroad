{"id":"5e9c29d19b6559241525d3dc","artists":["5e9b69637a1236eccfeb273e"],"title":"New: Young Diamonds – Innocent Wave","content":"<p>With only one track and an Essential Zones Mixtape to their name, Brooklyn’s <strong>Young Diamonds</strong> (Bob Maynard and Michael Wolfson) are fresh out the chillwave womb.</p><p> Their debut outing <em>Innocent Wave</em> is a vibrant blend of 80’s pop such as <strong>Depeche Mode</strong> and <strong>The Pet Shop Boys</strong> stirred with a healthy dose of more modern ‘alternative’ artists ala <strong>Neon Indian</strong> and <strong>Tanlines</strong>. The vocals are at times slightly less slick than the instrumental sections yet for a first attempt, it’s a mightily impressive one. As anthemic as it is understated, I really hope this isn’t the last we hear of <strong>Young Diamonds</strong>. Check out Innocent Wave below, as well as the Essential Zones mixtape below that.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=264351373/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40707351&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe><br />\nTracklisting:<br />\nCos – Perhaps Next Record (from Viva Boma / 1976)<br />\naBillion – Soldiers (from aBillion / 2011)<br />\nThe System – Don’t Disturb This Groove (Vocal Edit) (from Sweat / 1983)<br />\nThe New Division – Starfield (from The Rookie / 2010)<br />\nDavid Bowie – Ashes to Ashes (from Scary Monsters & Super Creeps / 1980)<br />\nThe Cure – Six Different Ways (from The Head on the Door / 1985)<br />\nScritti Politti – Hypnotize (from Cupid & Psyche 85 / 1985)<br />\nOneohtrix Point Never – Months (from Rifts / 2009)<br />\nLindsey Buckingham – DW Suite (Part 1) (from Go Insane / 1984)<br />\nCFCF – Raining Patterns (from Continent / 2009)<br />\nBill Wyman – Nuclear Reactions (from Bill Wyman / 1982)<br />\nBrian Eno & John Cale – Spinning Away (from Wrong Way Up / 1990)<br />\nArthur Russell – You Can Make Me Feel Bad (from Calling Out of Context / 2004)<br />\nActive Child – Hanging On (from Adult Swim Singles Program / 2011)<br />\nJill Jones – Violet Blue (vocal samples) (from Jill Jones / 1987)</p>\n","slug":"15786-new-young-diamonds-innocent-wave","category":"mpfree","date":1332532460000,"wpid":15786,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2012/03/2655844144-1-165x165.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587292625452,"updatedAt":1588443774917,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/2655844144-1-165x165.png","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
