A swirling, multi-layered number, working with complex percussion patterns, it’s by far the most atmospheric track in his series so far. What’s more, his ability to intertwine vocals appears to improve with each and every track, cementing his position as one of the finest young producers around at this moment in time.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F88900577\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21400-new-kodak-to-graph-aurescent","category":"mpfree","date":1366666131000,"wpid":21400,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":633,"src":"2013/04/375946_643323372359758_1296698865_n-950x633.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAIBAAAgAGAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMAAgQFESETMUFD4f/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDL7Y+ikt9Qp1PKxzFzEOm9JHWBjs73EfLQnZSzPnB+whAGo4X/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283584056,"updatedAt":1588443768866,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/04/375946_643323372359758_1296698865_n-950x633.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
