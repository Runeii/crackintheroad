The plodding mediocrity of <strong>the Shins</strong> over the last few years was, in 2010, eclipsed entirely by his team up with <strong>Danger Mouse </strong>to produce <em>Broken Bells</em>, the first and, to date, only LP from the band of the same name.</p>\n<p>Until now, that is. With <strong>Broken Bells</strong>‘ second album, <em>After the Disco</em>, scheduled for released in January, the band have released their first single from it – ‘Holding on for Life’ is a piece of <strong>Bee Gees</strong>-esque brilliance – as weird as it is outright fun – and one that clearly allows Mercer to actually have fun with his vocals and songwriting for once. It’s a good start for what could be one of 2014’s first brilliant albums.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/78536585\" height=\"140\" width=\"500\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"24861-new-broken-bells-holding-life","category":"music","date":1383584699000,"wpid":24861,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":658,"height":658,"src":"2013/11/broken-bells-after-the-disco2.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgH/xAAkEAACAgEDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAABBAIDEQAFYRMhBhUxMkFCUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAED/8QAHBEAAgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAERIhUWHB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAO/wCIXa3NwXqZZjVNiQ7XSwO5x88aX7S8x5Unlm8nowzmZP1HOq3tiBm3IoqmXX9TVHPulxpCmosE6AF6QBXEACA/NXOak7izG1Rz0z//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282802336,"updatedAt":1588403525331,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d16","old_image":"2013/11/broken-bells-after-the-disco2.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
