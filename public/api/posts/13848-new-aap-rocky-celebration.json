The production is slick and ready for the mainstream; fairly appropriate when you consider that he’ll be touring with <strong>Drake</strong> over the next few months.

It’s unclear as to whether this new cut will feature on next months <em><strong>A$AP MOB</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33418326\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33418326\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad/a-ap-rocky-celebration\">A$AP Rocky – Celebration (Unreleased)</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad\">crackintheroad</a></span></p>\n","slug":"13848-new-aap-rocky-celebration","category":"music","date":1326583555000,"wpid":13848,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293092624,"updatedAt":1588441783901,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/cce607c4d975ae49d68b484eaef51a6413fa73b1.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
