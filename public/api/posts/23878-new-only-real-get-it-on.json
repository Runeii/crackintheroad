With his first release on LuvLuvLuv Records out next month, an EP titled <strong><em>Days In The City</em></strong>, Niall Galvin draws from the likes of Beastie Boys and Tribe Called Quest, yet merging these influences with a modern, more anthemic style. <em>Get It On</em>, the first track to be taken from the aforementioned EP is a straight out jam, garage-rock riffs mixed with the laidback, intelligent delivery of Galvin. Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F105519100\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23878-new-only-real-get-it-on","category":"music","date":1376579167000,"wpid":23878,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":115,"src":"2013/08/onlyreal2_750_523_90_s-165x115.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUI/8QAHhAAAgICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIABQQRIVEDIjH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAiH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANG2tiuJc1OMfIFbKZ1VSD7aAJ+ccDuU9nuIhrl63//Z"},"createdAt":1587283073530,"updatedAt":1588443767424,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/onlyreal2_750_523_90_s-165x115.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
