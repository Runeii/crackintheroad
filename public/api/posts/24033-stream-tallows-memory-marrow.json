Having had it on repeat over the past month or so, I can wholeheartedly say that it’s one of my favourite records of 2013 thus far. Check out <strong><em>Memory Marrow</em></strong> in full below, including my personal favourite, <em>Mothball</em>, and download it from their <a href=\"https://tallowsmusic.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 758px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1055446301/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24033-stream-tallows-memory-marrow","category":"music","date":1377989982000,"wpid":24033,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283036522,"updatedAt":1588441763026,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/266aa8fa1b8b2dfb8ae102b3905ff2729fb8494c.jpg","categories":["music","stream","new"]}
