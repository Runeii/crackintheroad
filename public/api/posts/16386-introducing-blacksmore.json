However, <strong>Thomas Blacksmore</strong> has far more depth to his music than the dark visual element would suggest. His debut EP <em><strong>YOUTH</strong></em> is seven tracks of instrumental chillwave, built around contagious hooks and carefully structured percussion. Whilst at times it may lack personality, with a fairly similar atmosphere being expressed in each track, there are moments of pure bliss, most notably the sensational <em>DREAMS</em>.</p>\n<p>As indicated by <strong>BLACKSMORE</strong>, these songs are merely a collection of demos, however the potential they portray is astounding. <em>DREAMS</em> has the sort of dancefloor-filler riff that<strong> M83</strong> would kill for, whilst<em> HOLIDAYS</em> drifts by with it’s lulling, repetitive nature. Clearly a work in progress, there’s no doubting that at times <em><strong>YOUTH</strong></em> lacks a certain charisma, however theres no denying the vast ability it displays. Check out <em>DREAMS</em> below, and head to <strong>BLACKSMORE’s</strong> <a href=\"https://blacksmore.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> to stream the full release.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1472594078/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://blacksmore.bandcamp.com/track/dreams-demo\">DREAMS (DEMO) by BLACKSMORE</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16386-introducing-blacksmore","category":"introducing","date":1336335726000,"wpid":16386,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":117,"src":"2012/05/iwm-q12355-165x117.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMG/8QAHhAAAQQCAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEEBQYSITH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A1mHzCeVvSPj0bZbDS12UDRJr7Su7f7UOIbo8TqD5c6Ig/9k="},"createdAt":1587289515361,"updatedAt":1588443774121,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/05/iwm-q12355-165x117.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
