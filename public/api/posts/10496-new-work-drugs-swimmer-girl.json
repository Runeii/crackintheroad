Their <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/work-drugs\">Soundcloud </a> for example is over flowing with summer jams and interesting remixes. Their last single of the summer, <strong><em>Swimmer Girl</em></strong>, sees this work ethic continue, all without a dig in quality. The mellow, child like exuberance is ever present, with the lyrics filled with naive wonder and gentle devotion, “it’s so good when you laugh baby”. But as always with Work drugs, they not only wrap you in their world, they can get you off your seat. The groove is as strong as ever.</p>\n<p>Stream the new single and the accompanying video below.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F21615385\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F21615385\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/work-drugs/swimmer-girl\">Swimmer Girl</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/work-drugs\">Work Drugs</a></span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOT0F0RwUvg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10496-new-work-drugs-swimmer-girl","category":"music","date":1314050646000,"wpid":10496,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":579,"src":"2011/08/work-drugs.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAgICAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhESISIy/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAb/xAAcEQABBAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAEDBBESITH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AI6zvOdV+K67e0dzJZpR1GPmkzK0MXmiMpDdH9BR895m9jlm2lnkkk2d5ndizMZD2ST7J94xgqUQFtlvHVBbnLUSbmV//9k="},"createdAt":1587294005320,"updatedAt":1588403549903,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/08/work-drugs.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
