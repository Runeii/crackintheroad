Embodying the spirit of <strong>Weezer</strong> with the gritty, fuzz laden tunes of <strong>Wavves</strong>, the Florida four piece are rapidly becoming one of my favourite new acts of 2011. Their new video for <em>Outta’ Know</em> is a vibrantly colourful affair, documenting the group performing the track in a cramped studio space, and still managing to have a raucous time. Shot in front of an ever changing backdrop of disco-inspired colours, it’s simplicity in it’s most enjoyable form. You get the impression that you could stick these guys in a room together with nothing but their equipment, and they’d still have the time of their lives, and possibly even write a few anthemic tracks.
