In truth, it’s difficult to make comparisons or label his music with genre tags; the pitch-shifted vocals lend themselves to more R&B stylings whilst the beats come across much more like a teenage bedroom producer, chiseling their own path. Check out Coursing and Somativa below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F82019471\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F79727113\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20319-new-unmap-coursing-somativa","category":"mpfree","date":1363973721000,"wpid":20319,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283748546,"updatedAt":1588441768151,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2738d4d392e7b0768dd15e49a52.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
