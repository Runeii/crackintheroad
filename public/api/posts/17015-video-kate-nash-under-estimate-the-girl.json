Buried deep beneath deranged screeches and god awful guitar sections, there’s a very lackluster two finger salute to the music industry and ignorant society in general, but she appears to have forgotten that whilst music can carry an important message, it’s only worthwhile and portrayed accurately if the music itself is actually any good. While listening, please remember that this is the same girl who penned ‘<em>I use mouthwash, sometimes I floss, I have a family, and I drink cups of tea</em>‘; <strong>Kathleen Hanna</strong>, please look away now.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIB3YCGihp0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17015-video-kate-nash-under-estimate-the-girl","category":"music","date":1340030738000,"wpid":17015,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285054985,"updatedAt":1588441776442,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/980b6c7d05c2f8f661853f4fccc7580ebf891820.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
