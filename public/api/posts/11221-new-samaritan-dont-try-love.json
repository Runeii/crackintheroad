For a while the pages of <strong>CITR</strong> were completely dry when it came to UK artists, but for the moment we’ve hardly got room for anyone else.</p>\n<p>Norwich based producer <strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/samaritan\">Samaritan</a></strong> keeps the flame alive not so much in sound, but rather in the sense of maturity in which he embraces his craft. He’s been making music for some time now, but it’s his new track ‘<strong><em>Don’t try love</em></strong>’, that’s been doing the rounds on the blogosphere. At first it follows a well-trodden path; sparse sounds and industrial beats form the main emphasis of the track. But it’s the ideological message of piece that holds so much weight. The simple message, ‘Don’t try love’, brings with it a mature, or even wise sense of betrayal; yet it also sounds bitter and fool hardy. In short, it sounds like growing up, like going home alone after lusting after a girl at a house party all night. It feels like the shallow, yet at the time utterly real sense of loneliness and hopelessness.</p>\n<p>Stream the track below.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F22644756\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F22644756\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/samaritan/4-dont-try-love\">Don’t Try Love</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/samaritan\">Samaritan</a></span></p>\n","slug":"11221-new-samaritan-dont-try-love","category":"music","date":1315945026000,"wpid":11221,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/samaritan-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQGB//EACMQAQACAAUDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAEERIhBQYTMVFhkuH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBf/EABsRAAEEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAAQMEESEx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBTpPec4Qyl87LbLMuPmqhpCEhdDX3fzF5T3n0qyqE3MbWUR2pyfGMJAKr0AWPP3wWK7Tl9MSLFQCfLI0V0x11f/9k="},"createdAt":1587293865622,"updatedAt":1588403548137,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/09/samaritan-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
