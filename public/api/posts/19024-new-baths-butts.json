With a beat choppier than the North Sea combined with the occasionally shout of ‘butt’, it’s quite unlike anything you’ve heard before, and probably anything you’ll ever hear again. (P.S. what’s almost as good as the song itself is that people have gone along the Soundcloud timeline and commented ‘Butts’ everytime the word appears; I love you internet).</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74182533\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19024-new-baths-butts","category":"music","date":1357766100000,"wpid":19024,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":628,"src":"2013/01/201107181933155855-950x628.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAIRAAAQMDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDBAAFEQYSITETMtH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBP/EABgRAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgME/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDRYtRzHLtMfOaBW5YzYsRtiptNPY84zz1j5UParkC8aeAOCVO6UqQ6bpHtmDP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284211741,"updatedAt":1588443770768,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/01/201107181933155855-950x628.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
