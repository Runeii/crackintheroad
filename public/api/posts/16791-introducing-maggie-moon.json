{"id":"5e9c0ca1774c2610387e53d4","artists":["5e9b691e7a1236eccfeb22d6"],"title":"Introducing: Maggie Moon","content":"<p>Strolling onto the scene with a slightly ungainly youthful charisma and a twee take on riot grrrl, <strong>Maggie Moon</strong> may well have just invented bubblegumpunk (bubblegunk?).</p><p> Armed with quirky, upbeat choruses (<em>I Will Die</em>) and an almost sleazy ability to write sexually frustrated pop gems (<em>Shine</em>), this three track EP from the Pomona quintet is chockablock with thrills, frills and an adorable sense of friendship. ‘<em>You’re such a crazy loverboy</em>‘ screeches the female lead singer on <em>Boop Dap Beep Dap</em>, coming across like an even more lo-fi <strong>Be Your Own Pet</strong> or even <strong>Metric</strong> without the outlandish production values. Check out their debut EP <em><strong>Werewolf Thumb</strong></em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3299758446/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16791-introducing-maggie-moon","category":"introducing","date":1338901113000,"wpid":16791,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285153197,"updatedAt":1587825894670,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","news","music"]}
