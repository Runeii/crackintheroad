If we were to consider the vastly different opinions on it (from staggeringly out of touch Rolling Stone reviews, to twattish FACT reviews with appeals to modernity, to the markedly absent NME review) it’s probably best described as being full of ideas, but not quite meshing them together to the sort of satisfyingly cohesive and well written quality we quickly came to expect of them a decade ago.</p>\n<p>So then they go and release <em>Afterlife. </em>Gone is the rambling, repetitive styling; gone are the layers and layers of soaring synths. What we’re left with is the sort of electro-disco-inspired, percussion laden track that successfully evokes Haiti in the way we were promised so many months ago. Maybe that’s just the effect of setting the music to footage from <i>Black Orpheus. </i>At any rate the most important element, the actual song, seems to be far better this time around and much more what we expect of the band.</p>\n<p>And that’s the key point to consider – this is a song that is <em>fun</em>, regardless of how emotive it might be trying to be. How many of the other big bands from 2003/4 are still producing material you can say that about?</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75BFcH4u2k</p>\n","slug":"24694-new-video-arcade-fire-afterlife","category":"new","date":1382419091000,"wpid":24694,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":586,"src":"2013/10/arcade_fire-950x586.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIxAAAQMDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMEBQACIQcRExYiMVRx0f/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AxphqTNNo183VkpBW9e0BG/jG0I56sA7HcYz2qRzXKee4Psn7SlX55FC//9k="},"createdAt":1587282848697,"updatedAt":1588443766363,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2013/10/arcade_fire-950x586.jpg","categories":["new"]}
