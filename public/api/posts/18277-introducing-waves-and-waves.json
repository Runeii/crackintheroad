{"id":"5e9c0a21774c2610387e51d1","artists":["5e9b695d7a1236eccfeb26e7"],"title":"Introducing: Waves and Waves","content":"<p>From the stunning artwork (by Forty Ounce conspirators <a href=\"https://www.</p><p>johnsonanddrake.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Johnson & Drake</a>) to the simplistic yet bewitching song titles, there was no way that <strong>Waves and Waves</strong> debut LP <strong><em>Oceans</em></strong> could be anything other than absolutely amazing. Majestic, soaring soundscapes, characterised by their ethereal, drone-like qualities; it’s a record that’s truly a numbing experience, achieving a level of transcendental beauty. <strong>Waves and Waves</strong>, the project of <strong>Matt Saladino</strong> from LA is a humble affair, however somehow relatively knowledgable of it’s own qualities.</p>\n<p>With the open, innocent and starkly minimal <em>Swells</em> proving the pinacle of <em><strong>Oceans</strong></em>, it’s also one of the few tracks that features any vocals whatsoever, and most notably, no lyrics. The jangly guitar line is vaguely reminiscent of Foals, whilst the overall nostalgic and emotionally strained atmosphere brings about comparisons to <strong>Sigur Ros</strong>. As a full LP, it’s hardly worth mentioning individual tracks, simply due to the indescribable fluidity of the record. It’s a soundtrack to dreams, to sleep and to unparalleled beauty.
