His 2011 record, <em>Lately</em>, had us on the floor, literally, begging for life to always be this damn good. Sort of.</p>\n<p>Recently <strong>Evenings</strong> announced that, as he puts it, he would be “laying low”. The world does a little cry. Now me and <strong>Evenings</strong> might have slightly different opinions on what constitutes “laying Low”, but I’d assume that to most of the world it doesn’t mean; release a six minute, part soundscape, part soundtrack, part found sound jazz jam.</p>\n<p>I’m glad Evenings doesn’t know what “laying Low” means.</p>\n<p><em>Stays</em> is part of the <a href=\"https://www.fofmusic.net/\"><strong>Friends of Friends</strong></a> compilation ‘Show Me The Future’, which is released next week.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74013322\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19001-new-evenings-stays","category":"music","date":1357669834000,"wpid":19001,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":769,"src":"2013/01/evenings-950x769.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIH/8QAHRAAAwACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRMQUiwf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAES/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDG9Lylo6STetQqNyAesiu1J6u/A9iT0R8xjDYtl//Z"},"createdAt":1587284226541,"updatedAt":1588443770900,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/01/evenings-950x769.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
