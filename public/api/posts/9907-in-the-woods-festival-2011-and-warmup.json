Indeed,<strong>Micachu</strong> returns this year to play a headline set, off the back of their project with the <strong>London Sinfonietta Orchestra.</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>This is an event where c<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: small;\">utting edge music, arts and crafts collide in a forest-covered amphitheatre, where fans sample music, nature and locally sourced ale and food. With a bonfire and silent disco that goes until sunrise, a strict capacity of 500 tickets sold only to those on their mailing list and the overall individuality of the event, it is quickly becoming the festival season’s best kept secret. But, should you not be able to make it, <em>Crack in the Road</em> have been invited along to the party on the 3rd September and we promise to be trigger happy with our cameras to properly showcase the wonderful atmosphere of the site. There is also a warmup event that is sure to be unmissable.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Taking place at the <em>Hoxton Bar & Kitchen </em>in London on Thursday 25th August 2011, the event is put on for all the bands, DJs, artists, staff and volunteers helping to run this years festival. Featuring live warm-up sets from this years festival acts such as <strong>Post War Years</strong>, <strong>CLOUT! </strong>and festival hosts <strong>Laurel Collective</strong>, as well as DJ sets from <strong>Man Like Me </strong>and last year’s headliners <strong>The Invisible<em>.</em></strong> The atmosphere could never match the one of the woodland festival site, but with the performances allowing you to get a taste, it is still hotly anticipated.</p>\n<p>Even better, though, there are a limited number of tickets available to the general public to attend, though these are rapidly selling out. As an added incentive, the organisers have promised that everyone who buys one will also now be entered in to a draw to win two free tickets to the now sold out festival itself.</p>\n<p>So, if getting away from the Carling steeped piss bath that is most modern UK festivals is your sort of summer event, it makes sense to make every effort to attend.</p>\n<p><a title=\"In The Woods Warmup Party Tickets\" href=\"https://www.wegottickets.com/event/127938\">The few remaining tickets to the In the Woods Warmup Party are onsale here</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information on the festival itself, as well as to join the tickets mailing list, visit the <a title=\"In the Woods Festival\" href=\"https://www.inthewoodsfestival.co.uk \">In the Woods Festival website</a>.</p>\n","slug":"9907-in-the-woods-festival-2011-and-warmup","category":"festivals","date":1313397357000,"wpid":9907,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":633,"src":"2011/08/itws-300-image1-950x633.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAIhAAAQMDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhEhYQcTMUFR/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIsW6h45bLO5JNn0vjC+4xIG6UE8fN6zm4ToM+fJmPKfLsh1Ty9Anyokn1zSlO5FAw63T//Z"},"createdAt":1587294083687,"updatedAt":1588403550868,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2011/08/itws-300-image1-950x633.jpg","categories":["festivals","music"]}
