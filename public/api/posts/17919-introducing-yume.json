Well, yeah, that’s pretty much the case.</p><p> As with the likes of <strong>xxyyxx</strong>, <strong>Beat Culture</strong> and <strong>Hollow Pigeons</strong>, NY’s <strong>Yume</strong> (presumably pronounced You-Me) appears to find his inspiration amongst rap and glo-fi artists, with his debut EP <em><strong>Dreamt Of U</strong></em> showcasing a decidedly raw and illustriously unrefined talent.</p>\n<p>With cuts from the EP already having popped up on several other blogs (<a href=\"https://flashlighttagmusic.tumblr.com/post/31342150381\" target=\"_blank\">Flashlight Tag</a>, <a href=\"https://smokedontsmoke.com/post/31472186699\" target=\"_blank\">Smoke Don’t Smoke</a>, <a href=\"https://thenewblack.tumblr.com/post/31476343970/2gether-yume-experiments-in-love-and-synth-via?og=1&fb_action_ids=10101540934686343&fb_action_types=tumblr-feed%3Apost&fb_source=other_multiline&action_object_map={%2210101540934686343%22%3A428796457155579}&action_type_map={%2210101540934686343%22%3A%22tumblr-feed%3Apost%22}&action_ref_map=[]\" target=\"_blank\">GITNB</a>) over the last few days, it’s clear that he’s already making an immediate impact on the scene. Personal favourite, the <strong>Imogen Heap’s</strong> <em>Speeding Cars</em> sampling <em>There There</em> is awash with gorgeous hooks and lush instrumentation, a track with such an alluring atmosphere that it’s impossible to not be emotionally affected.
