Dark, gritty and uncompromising at times, the six minute epic that is <em>Familiar</em> is one of the most hard-hitting, unique songs I’ve heard in quite a while, switching effortlessly between her Angel Olsen-esque drawl and a heart stopping shriek. Lines such as “<span style=\"color: #363636;\">I’m older and skinnier / </span><span style=\"color: #363636;\">the lines look familiar / </span><span style=\"color: #363636;\">my hands might be shaky / </span><span style=\"color: #363636;\">but they look very similar” strike right to the core, as emotionally poignant as any you’ll hear this year, no doubt. Check out <em>Familiar</em> and <em>Filth</em> below.</span></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=608261410/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"https://alishabatth.bandcamp.com/track/familiar\">Familiar by Alisha Batth</a></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/192526699&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31151-introducing-alisha-batth","category":"introducing","date":1427497033000,"wpid":31151,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2048,"height":1360,"src":"2015/03/10750260_607775426019633_2342096645820041867_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMG/8QAIRAAAQQBAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABQYSE0JhgdH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Asnd0ZGoQXJctxCTFL8htLXJTtoSRSu2jZ9ZqxubRgAOvfktq+Yxgf//Z"},"createdAt":1587280352488,"updatedAt":1588403510223,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2015/03/10750260_607775426019633_2342096645820041867_o.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
