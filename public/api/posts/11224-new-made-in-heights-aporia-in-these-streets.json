I would point out an inspired parallel between the duo’s back-story and their dream-focused sound; it would have been delightful.</p>\n<p>Sadly the groups debut effort completely passed me by back in December of last year. I did, for the purpose of this article, go back and give it a listen. The results were hit and miss, especially after experiencing <em><strong>Aporia: In These Streets</strong>, </em><em>a record that states very firmly from the off what it came to do</em><em>. <strong><a href=\"https://madeinheights.bandcamp.com/album/winter-pigeons-songs-to-raise-your-dead-spirits\">Winter Pigeons (Songs To Raise Your Dead Spirits)</a></strong></em> just feels underdeveloped in comparison.</p>\n<p>The follow up from the duo, made up of Blue Scholars’ DJ/producer <strong>Sabzi</strong> and New York-based vocalist <strong>Kelsey Bulkin</strong>, is quite the treat. Made up of 6 originals and 5 separate instrumentals, it blends dream pop and trip hop sounds to form a blissed out stream of pop gems. Below are 3 highlights from the compilation.
