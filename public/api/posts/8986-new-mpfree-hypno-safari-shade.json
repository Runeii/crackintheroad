This year the Idaho capital has well and truly put itself on the musical map, with the likes of Youth Lagoon, Shades, Mozam Beaks and TEENS all hailing from the city of trees. Dream pop one piece Hypno Safari is the newest name to add himself to that already mega-talented list, with his debut track Shade. Drenched in Wavves inspired lo-fi fuzz, it’s angst driven in parts, whilst despairingly longing in others. The vocals are clear and decisive, almost drowned out in parts by the melancholic guitar section, yet there’s an admirable energy portrayed through the rawness of Shade, ‘and now this shit is burning up’ bemoans Hyde with vicious dismay. Having already cemented itself as ‘musical city of the year’ for me, Boise just keeps on unearthing this engaging and passionate gems.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1742063155/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://hypnosafari.bandcamp.com/album/shade\">Shade by Hypno Safari</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"8986-new-mpfree-hypno-safari-shade","category":"music","date":1309696111000,"wpid":8986,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/07/2924731931-1-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAf/xAAjEAACAQIEBwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMAIQUTIjEEBhEyQaKx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQb/xAAcEQABAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIRAxIxUdH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AK3zOZxPhwhEjrmsXVDva32lmW51+1JwMBuHhZgCwDHqd96TNFHnPoXuPiiTJN+1TF4EU4x1f//Z"},"createdAt":1587294245579,"updatedAt":1588403553362,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/07/2924731931-1-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
