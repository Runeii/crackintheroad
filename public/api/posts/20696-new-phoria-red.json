With utterly sublime vocals that float effortlessly between the layers of handclaps and film samples, it’s not too far from the ‘sadcore’ sound currently being pioneered by SOHN; yet with an added narrative element. Amidst the despair and desperation, there’s an underlying feelign that <strong>Phoria</strong> truly have a story to tell, and I’m more than eager to hear it. Check out<em> Red</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84756284\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20696-new-phoria-red","category":"music","date":1364683653000,"wpid":20696,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283690454,"updatedAt":1588441767560,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/601121a1cfd4ea0fe407f848875e63bcd0e3923d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
