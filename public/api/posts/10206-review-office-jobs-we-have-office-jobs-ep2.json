One night last week as I careened blindly across the limitless website like an Irishman in a Guiness Brewery, I happened across the bandcamp page of<strong> Friends Crossing</strong>, a Massachusetts based collective. This particular EP is the work of <strong>Justin Mantell</strong> going under the alias <strong>Office Jobs</strong>, and it’s four tracks of electro-acoustic delight.</p>\n<p>Opening track <em>Somebody Else</em> is predominantly acoustic, yet backed by a electronically produced drum beat, adding an extra dimension. The songwriting bares similarities to Norway’s <strong>Little Hands Of Asphalt</strong>, whilst the vocals are soothingly gentle. Coming in at under two minutes, <em>Stage Coach</em> is a pop beauty, yet maintains a raw, authentic feel. The same can be said of the alternative-rock influenced<em> Focus</em>, which reminds me of a New Jersey pop-punk outfit <strong>Hidden In Plain View</strong>. As an EP it’s the ideal length, allowing the listener a valuable insight into the music of <strong>Justin Mantell</strong> without entirely laying it’s hand out on the table, therefore building anticipation for a full length release. Make sure to check out <em><strong>We Have Office Jobs</strong></em>, which is available now on a pay-what-you-like basis via the<strong> Friends Crossing</strong> <a href=\"https://friendscrossing.bandcamp.com/album/we-have-office-jobs-ep\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1475680/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10206-review-office-jobs-we-have-office-jobs-ep2","category":"music","date":1313965450000,"wpid":10206,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/299703_225810640798504_218934914819410_617882_4971156_n-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwEI/8QAJhAAAgAGAQEJAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFESEScQYTFBUjJDFBUf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIE/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBgkXil71GNVKLYB242CcA4/CdRZnaK2825VtMGycgsujGcpxPldgmZ9Q+Gy32ffBfnprpB9faqol3u4Ik+aqLUTAFDkADkdCFAnPKP/9k="},"createdAt":1587294016587,"updatedAt":1588403550045,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/08/299703_225810640798504_218934914819410_617882_4971156_n-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","remixes"]}
