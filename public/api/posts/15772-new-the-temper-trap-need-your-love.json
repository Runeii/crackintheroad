Lyrically it’s not up too much, but hey, it’s relatively enjoyable, and I know if I had this blaring at a festival, it’d be irresistible to dance to. <em>Need Your Love</em> is the first single to be taken from their self-titled sophomore record out 21 May. Check it out below, and the tracklisting below that.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40599810&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Need Your Love</em><br />\n<em> London’s Burning</em><br />\n<em> Trembling Hands</em><br />\n<em> The Sea Is Calling</em><br />\n<em> Miracle</em><br />\n<em> This Isn’t Happiness</em><br />\n<em> Where Do We Go From Here</em><br />\n<em> Never Again</em><br />\n<em> Dreams</em><br />\n<em> Rabbit Hole</em><br />\n<em> I’m Gonna Wait</em><br />\n<em> Leaving Heartbreak Hotel</em></p>\n","slug":"15772-new-the-temper-trap-need-your-love","category":"music","date":1332515585000,"wpid":15772,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292630314,"updatedAt":1588441779718,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/3e415fd89d2aad51b9be6eb2cd0d94ed9c9e7a5b.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
