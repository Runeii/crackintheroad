Only a few months since she left KSIA, and new project <strong>Fina Fisken</strong> is already here, formed by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sarannah.p\"><strong>Sarah P.</strong></a> and producer <strong>Hior Chronik</strong>. <strong>Save The Day</strong> is a sweet surprise that caught me off guard, its dancing house vibes draws its atmosphere from the same source that <strong>Factory Floor</strong> or even <strong>Max Cooper </strong>did, setting the mood for the dreamy, ethereal vocals of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sarannah.p\"><strong>Sarah P.</strong></a> to kick in and elevate the whole experience to an otherworldly level. A mesmerising debut track that only promises the best and sucks the listener in to a dreamy state.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141058734″ params=”auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true” width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"27623-new-fina-fisken-save-day","category":"music","date":1395839215000,"wpid":27623,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2014/03/fina.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwYJ/8QAJhAAAgIBAQYHAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhITIVFhERQWIjFBgf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBzXaPTQtX04a1xHZCxj3txYjzYhgCC3Rcqkt1iikSqAR8MfA/ozN3Y+zPB5wQzyxjhg+xyPvtijp2oXTp9Ym3YJMS8+K3Qd8D/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282296601,"updatedAt":1588403517226,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d44","old_image":"2014/03/fina.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
