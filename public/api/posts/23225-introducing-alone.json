The Atlanta based project is fronted by lyricist Rico Howard accompanied by Tyler Rowan composing the music under Rico’s guidance.</p>\n<p>Crossing the boundary between spoken word and rap, Rico’s lyrics are macabre and fleeting, managing stay vague whilst striking uncomfortably honest and personal notes.</p>\n<p><em>“Flirting with death, thoughts in my head, things that I’ve said, blood that I’ve bled. I hear her calling, In silence and those dreams about falling, the embrace that I’m longing. The missing pieces, my overwhelming sense of belonging”</em></p>\n<p>Alone’s first self-titled track was posted on Bandcamp on 19th of July and yesterday the second track “Obligation” appeared. There’s very little else online but, as always, we’ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>Take a listen below or check out Alone’s facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alonegeorgia\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1152147022/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/seyyed_mostafa_zamani/6881449630/\">seyed mostafa zamani</a> via <a href=\"https://photopin.com\">photopin</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">cc</a></p>\n","slug":"23225-introducing-alone","category":"introducing","date":1374483862000,"wpid":23225,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283257906,"updatedAt":1588441764287,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d40","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273334485ef83aed87996906648.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
