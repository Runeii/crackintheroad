Over six months in the making, <em>We Can Create Our Own World </em>is the majestic debut from Pennsylvanian ambient post-rock five piece <strong>Deadhorse</strong>. Combining a masterful knowledge of classical composition, with haunting, progressive melodies, the album is an accomplished work of art.</p>\n<p>Album opener<em> No Particular Night Or Morning</em> opens with a simple yet effective piano riff, before condescending majestically into an atmospheric, organized chaos. Scintillating guitars compliment the powerful, commanding percussion, building layer after layer of sound which intertwine to form a beautiful, epic soundscape. No lyrics are needed to convey the dynamic, exquisite energy injected into each track.</p>\n<p><em>Questions For Which There Are No Answers </em>is a slow burning number, however once the piercing guitars kick in, the track steps up a notch, and forcefully grabs the listener by the scruff of the neck, tossing them around mercilessly, before planting them back down on their feet, feeling all the more re-invigorated for it. Elsewhere, <em>Visionaries</em> is an epic percussion lead track, with the drums guiding the rest of the instruments through the tumultuous depths of their sound capabilities. For a band to be able to conjure up such a fascinating and varied sound is a rare and admirable quality, there is a real sense of yearning after perfection on an<strong> Explosion in the Sky </strong>sort of level. By all means, the record is a challenging yet pulsating listen, driving the audience through a vast array of emotional highs and lows, moving from being viciously threatening to delicately angelic, a true sign of a brilliant post-rock record.</p>\n<p><em>We Can Create Our Own World</em> is out now, available from the <em>Deadhorse</em> bandcamp site, as either digital download or a physical CD, also be sure to check out their merchandise for some fantastic t-shirts!
