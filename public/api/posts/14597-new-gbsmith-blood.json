His eloquent lyrics and handsome vocals display a maturity far beyond his tender age, yet it’s his partially his inexperience that makes <em>Blood</em> such a vividly engaging listen. <em>‘I like the girls with the blue eyes and the brown stare’</em> laments <strong>Smith</strong> with such an admirable honesty, scarcely found in modern music. Entirely acoustic, <em>Blood</em> excels upon it’s minimal albeit all-encompassing feel, drawing the listener in and then breaking their heart.
