It’s energetic, fiery and witty; without coming off as self-indulgent or stammeringly generic. Formed from the ashes of Drive Like I Do, and maintaining a marked proportion of their songs, but I’ll disregard that for the course of this article and let the music speak for itself. Obvious and slightly lazy comparisons have been drawn to Kings of Leon, particularly in the raw and jagged guitar sound, yet for me there’s hints of Pulp within the sexually yearning and insightful lyrics, albeit the sound itself is perhaps less sensual and seductive. Sure to be a crowd pleaser at festivals, and possibly one of the top indie tunes of the year.
