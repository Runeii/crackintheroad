Showing the sort of diversity of sound that has allowed him to become one of 2015’s most exciting artists, it’s refreshing to hear a musician so intricately consider all aspects of their performance. Check out the cover below, alongside current single, Chemical.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197975297&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191838019&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31143-new-jack-garratt-let-me-love-you-live-cover","category":"music","date":1427472232000,"wpid":31143,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587280354552,"updatedAt":1588441753029,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/e99e7ddfb7bdb4aea49d3ac625ca65a1be7e3311.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
