Her debut E.P <em>Silver Currents</em>, which we are delighted to premiere, brings together the dreamy shoegaze and all encapsulating sound that I’ve grown to love and presents it in the shape of five perfectly crafted tracks. From the drifting guitars of<em> Come On</em> to the crushing <em>Set Fire</em>, this really is how a debut release should be done. <em>Time Pilot</em> closes the E.P in spectacular fashion, floating through your head, bringing you back to earth after what really is a beautiful journey.</p>\n<p>Stream the E.P below which is released 28 October.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/49586103&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30169-premiere-wedding-silver-currents-ep","category":"music","date":1414451174000,"wpid":30169,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281818360,"updatedAt":1588441753411,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2738f472a9a4e7e32033f7a1125.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
