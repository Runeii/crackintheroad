The repetitive chorus has a truly addictive quality, and the brief taste of an instrumental section at the end of the track is begging to be further explored and enjoyed. The band have a selection of other tracks available to stream, and they only go further to demonstrate their considerable level of potential.</p>\n<p>Very little information is currently available about Res, however I’m in no doubt it wont be long until you start hearing more and more about this exciting new outfit.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/111079219\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25046-introducing-res","category":"music","date":1385733630000,"wpid":25046,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/11/res.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgUH/8QAJhAAAQIEAwkAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAMREhMhQQUUIiQxMkJRsf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIG/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8APMbJS0omIuSrKiibTQHqNc6Qna7Sc7tK5I9g8SNPURXSjMntsQlVCqlxrThjR2JJZNyTnhp+QVJQVU5rR//Z"},"createdAt":1587282741860,"updatedAt":1588403524640,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2013/11/res.jpg","categories":["music","newnews"]}
