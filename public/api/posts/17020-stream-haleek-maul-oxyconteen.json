Must be strange for him that he’s achieved more in a matter of months than most musicians do in their entire career, however once you hear his music you can understand why.</p><p> Intelligent, aggressive and provoking, his music showcases the inner turmoil of a confused, disillusioned adolescent, and it’s never sounded better. Check out his debut EP <em><strong>Oxyconteen</strong></em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2122414&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17020-stream-haleek-maul-oxyconteen","category":"music","date":1340034232000,"wpid":17020,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285053212,"updatedAt":1588441776415,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/c9e7639b8356dcb67a940df3ab40062a14014d4a.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
