So, I guess, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: The shows title LAB due to the relation to both your work and your studio practice, can you explain how you feel about this and how the title was formed?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> A three-letter title was maybe my reaction to the on-and-on going trend of having paragraphs as exhibition- and work titles.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: How does this idea of lab vs artist studio relate to you? Do you see them as the same or different?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> Both are confined areas where the process of searching and experimenting is celebrated. With my installations I maybe recreate such areas.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: The idea of a lab brings ideas of cleanliness and tidy space, does this relate to your studio and/ or practice?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> I do sometimes tidy my studio.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_26978\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26978\" class=\"size-large wp-image-26978\" alt=\"Ophelia Finke, Schnell, 2013 (Installation view) Helmet, Perspex, Hay Bale, Wood, Paint\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/02/schnell_INSTALLATION_view_2013_Ophelia_Finke-640x426.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-26978\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ophelia Finke, Schnell, 2013 (Installation view) Helmet, Perspex, Hay Bale, Wood, Paint</p></div>\n<p><strong>JP: I can see this idea of a lab in your practice with the strong use of white and items like test tubes, bottles of chemicals etc, but then we see bales of hay and glossy coats with digital printed jungle senses, what are you thoughts on the cross overs?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> There wasn’t a lab if there wasn’t a glossy coat, a farm or a jungle. Like there wasn’t any hot without the cold. So I think they’re all part of each other.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: How do you decide which objects are present or presented with each other?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> It’s like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, some things just belong together.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: Could you talk a bit about how you make your objects?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> It’s a ménage à trois between head, hand and heart.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: You seem to build environments do you agree?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> That’s right.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_26973\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26973\" class=\"size-large wp-image-26973\" alt=\"Ophelia Finke, Explorer Red 2013, (Installation view), resin, varnish, plastic.\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/02/Explorer_red_2013_Ophelia_Finke-640x543.jpeg\" width=\"640\" height=\"543\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-26973\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ophelia Finke, Explorer Red 2013, (Installation view), resin, varnish, plastic.</p></div>\n<p><strong>JP: We see a repetition of the glossy coats in your work is there a meaning behind this?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> My coats are the armours of today’s explorers. They protect the adventurer while searching and exploring, like a Siegfried-Skin. They might also remind you of Joseph Beuys’ Felt-suits.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: What do you enjoy most about your practice?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> The theory, maybe.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: Where do you get most of your inspirations?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF: </strong>It’s an all-day aspiration of inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>JP: You will be showing at Liverpool’s Royal Standard Gallery at the end of this month, what else do you have planned for the rest of this year?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OF:</strong> There are some more shows coming, stay updated!</p>\n<p><strong>JP: Thank you for your time.</strong></p>\n<p>———————————————–</p>\n<p>Ophelia Finke’s work is on show at <a href=\"https://www.bearspace.co.uk/\"><strong>Bearspace</strong></a> until the 28th February, so you have to be quick if you want to see it!
