So it has touches of early<strong> Coldplay</strong> (think Parachutes, Rush of Blood to the Head), yet with tender undertones, marked most pointedly by the imperfect nature of the vocals. Check out <em>Grindstone</em> below, alongside a remix of the so far unheard Wolves, taken from <strong>Lake Island’s</strong> debut LP Outermost, released fall 2013.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F6343908\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22464-new-lake-island-grindstone","category":"mpfree","date":1371131714000,"wpid":22464,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283406958,"updatedAt":1588441765583,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273bffd75313fe88cecdd684690.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
