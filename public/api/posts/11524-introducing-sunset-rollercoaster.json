The melodies are thoughtful and insanely catchy, whilst the imperfect grasp of English is delightfully attractive. Inspiration wise, it couldn’t be blunter, throwing both<strong> The Rolling Stones</strong> and<strong> The White Stripes</strong> into the mixing pot, however it’s schizophrenic in it’s sound, leaping excitedly between various indie genres of the past thirty years. At times, <strong>Sunset Rollercoaster</strong> feel like they’ve been brought up on a staple diet of classic records from the past few decades, and this collection of tracks is the product of such lifestyle. Check out some choice cuts below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3919101673/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11524-introducing-sunset-rollercoaster","category":"introducing","date":1317759180000,"wpid":11524,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/10/290568_208744985849296_166203960103399_599406_7263061_o-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587293745173,"updatedAt":1588403546536,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/10/290568_208744985849296_166203960103399_599406_7263061_o-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
