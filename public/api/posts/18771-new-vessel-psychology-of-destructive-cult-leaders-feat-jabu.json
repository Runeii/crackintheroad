Jabu","content":"<p>As far as first years go, 2012 has been a remarkable one for the 22 year old artist <strong><a title=\"New: Vessel – Scarletta / Metle\" href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/13756-new-vessel-scarletta-metle/\">Vessel</a></strong>. His debut LP, <em>Order of Nois</em>e, proved to be quite the critical hit when in dropped on <strong>Triangle Records</strong> in October. The order of noise <em>is</em> changing;<strong> Actress</strong>, <strong>Lukid</strong> and <strong>Hype Williams</strong> are all proving successful, to a public that finally seems able to accept more experimental forms of electronic music. His new cut, <em>Psychology Of Destructive Cult Leaders</em>, brings these textures and ideas to the fray once more, this time with <strong>Jabu</strong>, a fairly unknown MC with one mind-web of a flow. The dense, industrial and challenging sounds are still present, but it now features a remarkably human touch, that the album perhaps lacked.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F71340997\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18771-new-vessel-psychology-of-destructive-cult-leaders-feat-jabu","category":"music","date":1355760011000,"wpid":18771,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284330709,"updatedAt":1588441772415,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/943a692d5b19dfd232679d2148cce860697e97d8.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
