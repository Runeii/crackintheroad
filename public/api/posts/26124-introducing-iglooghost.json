Irish-born Seamus Malliagh continues to channel the clear Flying Lotus influences evident in his previously released tracks (particularly the colourful title, ‘Peanut.smoker’, also taken from ‘Treetunnels’) through this intricate and satisfying short piece.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129616006″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n<p>Those influences are somewhat softened here, though – if ‘Peanut.smoker’ borrows a lot from the intense and absorbing ‘Cosmogramma’, this track is a lot more like the delicate output from ‘Until the Quiet Comes’. ‘Oolong_tea’ mainly consists of raw hip-hop beats, echoed vocal sampling, and is textured by a rising, atmospheric synth. The quality of the end product is helped along by the contribution of Italian singer, Kae, whose dreamlike and melodic vocals really hold the track together.</p>\n<p>Considering Malliagh is still only seventeen, he could well be one to watch if he builds on these tracks and moves into territory he can claim as his own. Certainly, it’ll be interesting to see this EP fully fleshed out. Check out both extracts from the promising young beatmaker and keep eyes peeled for ‘Treetunnels’ in full. It will be released by Error Broadcast on 28th January.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zVvxbZWD32c\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26124-introducing-iglooghost","category":"music","date":1390259630000,"wpid":26124,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":488,"height":488,"src":"2014/01/unnamed.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAKCAIAAAACUFjqAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABIElEQVR4nB2Ny0rDQBRAZ9WuBTeC1klo936LfyBumjSZPECkmRmL984I4qZ7IZNYtLgQ+kAQWolJLYVo936OtHB258AhDf5KZX4qdnSEoTyj3Bzxp4Nk1Oy/EFvmhQ5WmpWKDUFOIK6xey6HZ/zxMBmRjswKHXxrVumgO7g3t9dbdMLB3cXNw3GSkbbMlzosdFCi/wxX7xhV6NXo/KnLNk/3WkWfKiiV/wZxpbwS/Q26G3RaSUYsmVea/Wj3A8MZREv0K+ytsferunaSkhMxWmm/1s4M4gnEcwgnEC9gF9HEECryjfa22lkiq5UzhWgK0Rd6C2SUG9ISeaFYofz91Vsrd43uHMIZhDvdTMaWyCyR2cLYPKXcUG5sbiyeNvrjf3zMljfIXPPbAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"},"createdAt":1587282522798,"updatedAt":1588403521021,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d4a","old_image":"2014/01/unnamed.png","categories":["music","new"]}
