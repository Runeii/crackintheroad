Oh and they brought along a solid, tropical-pop song to boot.</p>\n<p>(That comparison in 3, 2, 1…)</p>\n<p><strong>Animal Collective</strong> have always been their most obvious and unavoidable comparison  – not least back on <i>Cola</i> where, even with full knowledge that it isn’t, there are moments where <strong>Avey Tare</strong> may well have wandered in to the recording. But to be fair to them, Seafood suggests their sound is moving away from outright aping to more of a ‘strong influence’.</p>\n<p>On <i>Seafood, </i>a tighter, less claustrophobic mix works wonders in emphasizing the sun-scorched calypso atmosphere, whilst the chorus is one of <i>those </i>ones you’ll have in your head for a while after the track finishes.</p>\n<p>All in all, <strong>Beaty Heart</strong> are off to a – if not life changing – great start and we can only hope their album will be drop before the nights grow long again.</p>\n<p>Give it, a remix and other cut <i>House the Boat</i> a listen below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3850572\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3854771\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20166-new-beaty-heart-seafood","category":"music","date":1361991768000,"wpid":20166,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":607,"src":"2013/02/8492754466_16b5c29133_b-950x607.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAhEAACAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAUhBhETIjFBUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME/8QAHBEAAgAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAxEhMVHB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCPxnH8S2Oae8xUL3NoIgRHcOqTHynssPrWtdVPycamkdnjisERiSF9tD8+KUopd2au+FbYgf/Z"},"createdAt":1587283859484,"updatedAt":1588443769404,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2013/02/8492754466_16b5c29133_b-950x607.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
