The influence of a certain reviled type of dance music are obvious: if the duo cranked up the bass during the chorus and emphasised the saw sounds, you could probably soundtrack a shitty Internet Explorer advert.</p>\n<p>It’s a good job then that they didn’t, instead crafting two slices of top quality synth-pop. Fans of <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>FOE </b>and Bell’s old collaborators <strong>Chairlift </strong>will dig this to no end. </span></p>\n<p>Hopefully we’ll be seeing a lot more of them in the near future, but for now you can pick up the tracks on vinyl/download via Moshi Moshi, or stream <em>Oyster </em>and personal preference <em>Know Yourself </em>below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/94791825″ params=”secret_token=s-u7U7O” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/102391652″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"23472-new-nothankyou-oyster","category":"new","date":1375166237000,"wpid":23472,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":970,"height":600,"src":"2013/07/nothankyou970600.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABQYxBxIh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8At+ZOcw9NHlSo+tdU/MfaRKUXlD3LYtBFH5VJ6qx3m4a3eIXroq1NrKlNIJJNkmhjGTaP/9k="},"createdAt":1587283199104,"updatedAt":1588403528668,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2013/07/nothankyou970600.jpg","categories":["new"]}
