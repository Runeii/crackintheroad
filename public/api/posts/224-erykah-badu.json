Return Of The Ankh","content":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Erykah Badu</strong> recently released her latest album <em>New Amerykah Part 2.</p><p> Return Of The Ankh</em>, a record to partner her previous effort <em>4th World War</em>. <strong>Erykah Badu</strong> describes <em>Return of the Ankh</em> as a representation from the right side of her brain, which makes for a carefree and emotionally driven record to contrast the intensity of <em>4th World War</em>. The album was produced by many, including <strong>J Dilla</strong>, <strong>Questlove</strong>, <strong>Madlib</strong>, <strong>James Poyser</strong> and <strong>Georgia Anne Muldrow</strong> who all give it quite a hip-hop edge. The record is so warm and full of bass that it makes you feel fuzzy inside and the hip hop element gives it head bopping addictiveness. All the tracks are superb, however the two standout tracks for me would be <em>Love</em>, produced by the much mourned, late <strong>J Dilla</strong> and <em>Window Seat</em>. <em>Love</em> is a song comparing adoration and fear to vibratory frequencies, the song is introduced delightfully by <strong>Erykah</strong> and the beat is a soulful masterpiece that Dilla fans will instantly recognise and love, with the vocals complimenting it perfectly, soulful and catchy. <em>Window Seat</em> is perhaps predictably great for listening on the bus, a super smooth track discussing love and loneliness.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Return of the Ankh</em> brings <strong>Erykah Badu</strong> back under the spotlight in style, with romantic charm and smooth production.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?miziozymdjq\">Love</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.erykahbadu.com/\">Official Site</a></p>\n","slug":"224-erykah-badu","category":"music","date":1271337758000,"wpid":224,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":323,"src":"2010/04/erykah+badu+673.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAhEAABAwQBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMRAAQFMQcGEhMhQf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCf2mUv8ryJc9NXRZOLS/4mrVIhpttJGh8VBBnczVVXw/jUqI7k+jGzSlB//9k="},"createdAt":1587295353392,"updatedAt":1588403568966,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d18","old_image":"2010/04/erykah+badu+673.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
