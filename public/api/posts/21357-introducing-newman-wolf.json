Recorded over the course of several months, between his own bedroom and studios at California Institute of The Arts, Wavs is a fairly intimidating listen. Entirely instrumental, it’s production is clean, crisp yet daring, never delving fully into deep house, whilst inject a slow burn into each track, that feels both spacious and intimate at the same time. Check out the EP in full below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3984474314/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21357-introducing-newman-wolf","category":"introducing","date":1366384800000,"wpid":21357,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":950,"src":"2013/04/1931186327-1-950x950.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQf/xAAiEAABBAEEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEBREABhIhE0JRcfH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEAAv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Aj2ydiV9vRGynylhHLxkN9cD+ZOp7PjiNOkMJWFpacUgLHsAcZ0xW2tjDrnIsSfLYivE+Rlp5SULzgHkkHB6+dFSAA+4B0Ao4A+9J2EJj4Wt3/9k="},"createdAt":1587283592242,"updatedAt":1588443768946,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/04/1931186327-1-950x950.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
