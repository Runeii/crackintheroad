With his debut record <em><strong>AMULET</strong></em> receiving critical acclaim across the blogosphere, and new material on the horizon, his unique brand of dream inspired electro-pop is sure to create even more of a stir in 2012. Having just released a new track, the 80’s disco influenced <em>The Lucania</em>, <em><strong>CitR</strong></em> caught up with <strong>TEEEL</strong> to get a few questions answered. Check out the interview and a couple of tracks below.</p>\n<p><em>CitR: What do you see as the main inspirations behind TEEEL, both musically and otherwise?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lately, I’ve been drawing inspiration from the weather changing over to winter. My recent tracks have been a bit darker than I normally write under the TEEEL name. I generally draw inspiration from movies, other musicians and artists, my friends and what mood I’m in. And sometimes, I’ll find a new synth sound and go from there. It really comes from everywhere, I guess.</strong></p>\n<p><em>There appears to be quite an 80’s disco vibe to some of your stuff, especially new track The Lucania, would you agree with that assumption?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, I have a collection of songs I’m finishing up now, some are dark and emotional dreamwave and some are light, fun and dancy. I usually bucket my song ideas in sub-styles on my computer and then eventually narrow down the songs I want to finish. “The Lucania” is actually a nod to my friend Chris Lucania. He was a big inspiration to me getting into metal and darker electronic music in the late 90s. I thought it was appropriate to give it away on Halloween. We are actually doing a show together to feature his paintings and I’m going to do a live performance.</strong></p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26692717\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26692717\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/teeel/teeel-the-lucania\">The Lucania</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/teeel\">Teeel</a></span></p>\n<p><em>How much do you think the environment and area that you grew up in have impacted on the music that you create?</em></p>\n<p><strong>It actually has made a major impact in my life. Living in NJ and being so close to both NY and Philly has spoiled me with talent as long as I can remember. There were loads of hard rock, punk and metal bands in my town. I played in a coupe bands and then eventually fell in love with drum and bass and electronic music. At the time, Philly had a massive scene and I was only 30 minutes away to seeing a headlining UK artist. It’s something that will always be a part of me.</strong></p>\n<p><em>What’s your standard songwriting process, and what equipment/programs do you tend to use?</em></p>\n<p><strong>I don’t really have an exact process. I’ll comp ideas and work on them for an hour or two. If I go back the next day and hear what I like, I’ll set up my hardware synths, record some guitars and lay in temporary vocals. From there, I finesse the song until I feel it’s finished. Some songs can come together in a night, some take a solid week to finish and about 75% of my ideas don’t see the light of day.</strong></p>\n<p><em>What are your plans and future aspirations for TEEEL?</em></p>\n<p><strong>I really would love to visit some other countries and rock out with my fans.</strong><br />\n<strong>I’m hoping in the spring I’ll have a booking agent and can move forward. Other than playing more shows, I plan on continuing to push out new material.</strong></p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25619548\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25619548\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/teeel/moving-on-teeel-remix\">Falcon Lake – Moving On (TEEEL Remix)</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/teeel\">Teeel</a></span> </p>\n<p><em>If you had to describe your own music in three words, what would you say?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Synths, Space and Dreams.</strong></p>\n<p><em>And finally!
