{"id":"5e9bf7ee8fb2d30d7769c897","title":"Introducing: HÅN","content":"<p>It’s been a little while since I last shared the music of an Italian artist, hence my excitement at hearing <strong>HÅN</strong> and her spellbinding debut, <em>The Children</em>.</p><p> Hailing from near <a href=\"https://www.visitgarda.com/en/garda_lake/\">Lake Garda</a>, her first outing is as majestic as the scenery of the area, recalling the likes of Daughter and second album Ben Howard (which I utterly adore). Clocking in at under three minutes, one can’t help but feel like it’s all over slightly too soon, however if that’s not a way to keep a listener on the edge of their seat for more, then I don’t know what is. Check out The Children below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/322853935&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5AzTltq8p1hVjYmch3adSB\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33640-introducing-han","category":"introducing","date":1496162358000,"wpid":33640,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1280,"height":1280,"src":"2017/05/artworks-000222778434-g3sjnw-original.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwQF/8QAJRAAAgAEBAcBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQSBhEhMQUjMzRBcXKB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AErGMvjIxiDSKzUjOzXl3uQLq1oBy8jfL9hZoeyp8yTy11O+0YdWBdO+zFkrpJ6EB//Z"},"createdAt":1587279854076,"updatedAt":1588403500463,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/05/artworks-000222778434-g3sjnw-original.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
