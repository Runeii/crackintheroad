I’ll be interested to see what the split is.</p>\n<p><em>Perfectly</em>, taken from his EP <em>Still Awake</em>, is due to drop next week and gives us an idea of what the collection of tunes may sound like. This is fun as hell beat music, but as with all of <strong>Hemsworth</strong>’s work he cleverly undercuts the experience with decisions that shifts the piece into an area of sorrow and contemplativeness.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F92357520\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21923-new-ryan-hemsworth-perfectly","category":"music","date":1368729019000,"wpid":21923,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283501444,"updatedAt":1588441766396,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/0635174c69e5933b1839158d3a4dd4dfeca8a766.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
