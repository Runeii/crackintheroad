The L.A. area quartet made up of  Samson, Tessa (vocals), Erik, and Nate, blend whispery vocals, mellowed acoustics, and rippling bass to create hypnotic tracks that whip up sonic dreamscapes you’ll trip over yourself to get lost in. Their latest offering, “Beacon,” premiering here, does not fail in its transportive perfection. It’s almost as if you can imagine them sitting far in the middle of a desert around a flickering bonfire and singing until the last drop of heat leaves the air leaving you shivering in the darkness. The visuals are easy because the sound is inspiring in its simplicity. It’s not easy which makes DEAREST one of my favorite under-the-radar acts this year.</p>\n<p>Photo provided by DEAREST, taken by Tessa.</p>\n","slug":"30021-premiere-beacon-dearest","category":"music","date":1412606551000,"wpid":30021,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281852871,"updatedAt":1588441754069,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273792fee7ac8cbd41d92bddb15.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
