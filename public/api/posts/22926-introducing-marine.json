With four tracks recorded in spring of this year at Garys Electric Studio in Brooklyn, <strong>Daigle</strong> shows a tender, albeit pop-orientated focus to his music. Take opening track <em>Release Me</em>, electro-pop at it’s most realistic and downright brilliant, not losing sight of the songwriting amidst the at times intentionally off key production. Whilst the aforementioned artwork, and overall ‘image’ sadly detract from the quality of Marine’s music, with the right advice and promotion, there’s no reason why he cannot become a household name.
