Mustachioed drummer, Craig Nice, had to play his beats “punk rock style” on an accoustic kit & guitarist, Andy Rauworth, was equally as unfortunate when his guitar decided to cut out mid song.</p>\n<p>Despite these setbacks and the shortlived set, the band made up for the lack of electricity with an abundancy of energy. Playing a gig in a near-empty bar, thousands of miles from home and with a shitty sound engineer shouldn’t enthuse anybody but for Gauntlet Hair it seemed like just another day at the office.</p>\n<p>This gig was organised by <a href=\"https://unevenblonde.tumblr.com/\">Uneven Blonde,</a> a Sheffield based independent promoter who continues to bring great music to the Steel City.</p>\n","slug":"15229-gig-review-gauntlet-hair-at-the-bowery-sheffield-200212","category":"live-reviews","date":1329827122000,"wpid":15229,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292785146,"updatedAt":1588441781047,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d40","old_image":"2012/02/gauntlet-hair-1-165x123.jpg","categories":["live-reviews","music"]}
