Lakutis’ lyrics tend to be quick-fire and referential, favouring splattering homophones and shout-outs to film and TV in his nasal tones. The album title itself is a reference to the Snipes/Stallone masterpiece Demolition Man. If you use the term masterpiece lightly.</p>\n<p>The beats are constantly intriguing and come from a number of underground producers, as well as some more established names like Hot Sugar, with Steel Tipped Dove providing some of the stand-out tracks. The only song that left me feeling a bit cold is ‘Body Scream’, which comes across as a cheesy rap slow jam, but pretty much everything else on the mixtape is fire. Listen to ‘Too Ill For The Law’ or ‘Jesus Piece’ and tell me I’m wrong.</p>\n<p>You can give <em>3 Seashells </em>a spin below and download it in the same place. Rappers this good need to get paid.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=126553349/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26916-mixtape-lakutis-three-seashells","category":"newmixtapes","date":1392919704000,"wpid":26916,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":534,"src":"2014/02/lakutis-jesus-piece-prod-steel-t-950x534.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAhEAEAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAUxBhETIRJBQv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMRIUHw/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCSbV1Dp49K7ldVt2lk7Y1RoZ0xPIT7h5A9KPL+j1k6vr+d9klBlJe0Qic/QcYxhRqrGkyl22f/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282394695,"updatedAt":1588443765221,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"2014/02/lakutis-jesus-piece-prod-steel-t-950x534.jpg","categories":["newmixtapes","new","mixtapes","music","newnews"]}
