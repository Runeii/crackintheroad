{"id":"5e9c2cdd9b6559241525d691","artists":["5e9b691e7a1236eccfeb22d0"],"title":"New: Machinedrum – SXLND","content":"<p>As if <strong>Machinedrum</strong> couldn’t kill it any more this year.</p><p> The Brooklyn producer released <em>Many Faces</em> last year on <strong>LuckyMe</strong>, announcing his comeback and cementing him as a significant face on the bass scene. Then he only comes and releases a terrifyingly top-marks album on <strong>Planet Mu</strong>, called <em>Room(s)</em>, a recent critical hit with his mate <strong>Braille</strong> as their <strong>Seplacure</strong> project on <strong>Hotflush</strong>, and a not-ready-for-this underhyped single on <strong>LuckyMe</strong> (that was <em>Alarma</em>). Not only has he done this, but he produced the hot-as-shit <strong>Azealia Banks</strong> track <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/12569-new-azealia-banks-grand-scam-lyrical-exercise/\" target=\"_blank\">we covered just a week ago</a>.</p>\n<p>This run he’s got going doesn’t look to be letting down, as shown from clips of his new release on <strong>LuckyMe</strong>, due next week (29th). Ignoring the brash “LUCKY ME!” promo shouts/whispers, you can preview the EP below. And it looks to be another hip-bopping housy affair. Let’s hope this guy doesn’t have a heart attack soon: electronic music today would have a massive void to fill.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to clips from SXLND below.</em></p>\n<p><center><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28680305&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28680305&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></center></p>\n","slug":"12799-new-machinedrum-sxlnd","category":"music","date":1321991534000,"wpid":12799,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293405300,"updatedAt":1588441785664,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/2d4708738af9d0dbedbe91cf74a17c9daf9fa5ba.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
