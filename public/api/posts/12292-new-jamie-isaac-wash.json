An ambient inspired number, keeping the vocals to a bare minimum thus allowing each word to gain far greater relevance, it’s another stunning progression of his ever-developing sound. Now with six tracks under his belt, <strong>Jamie Isaac</strong> is well and truly beginning to establish a name for himself, and it’s surely only a matter of time before the offers come calling.
