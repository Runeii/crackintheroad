New single A Stutter and a Start is relatively understated when compared to their previous release, the fourteen minute epic that was The First Of Many Dreams About Monsters. However it’s still a cracking track; jagged guitars and somber, honest vocals make up A Stutter and A Start, which tells the story of a person in turmoil, with relationships, their well being and even their car. The video follows a simple thematical issue, a one take job showing the band helping out the protagonist with his every day chores, ranging from cleaning his teeth to stumbling home drunk from a night out.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzByxFhtR4k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"6525-review-video-spring-offensive-a-stutter-and-a-start","category":"music","date":1302804468000,"wpid":6525,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294517090,"updatedAt":1588441789594,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/04/spring_offensive-casual-292x50.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
