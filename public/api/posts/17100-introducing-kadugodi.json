And that is exactly what happened to me this afternoon when I stumbled across the beautifully atmospheric ambient electronica of Kadugodi.</p>\n<p>Beginning with an infused hip hop beat, Kadugodi’s debut EP then moves into more chilled territory, enterprising on clear, crisp percussion and feathered touches of piano. It is this confidence from it’s minimalism that is particularly striking, with each track allowed to resonate in a similar pattern to waves lapping against a tranquil shoreline. I could not be any more relaxed.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3713573709/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17100-introducing-kadugodi","category":"introducing","date":1340712405000,"wpid":17100,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285019057,"updatedAt":1588441776285,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2012/06/kadugodi-950x950.png","categories":["introducing","music"]}
