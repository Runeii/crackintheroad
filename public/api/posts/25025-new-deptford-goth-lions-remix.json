I’ve always admired Deptford Goth’s somber sounds and glossy piano’s, but its refreshing to hear his voice so distorted. To hear his melodies turned gritty.  It’s a side of Deptford that I wouldn’t mind hearing again.</p>\n<p>If a little mental journey is something you’re looking for you should probably hit play. (Best with headphones and the lights out)</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/121684736″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"25025-new-deptford-goth-lions-remix","category":"music","date":1385413996000,"wpid":25025,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":648,"height":357,"src":"2013/11/deptford-goth-union-liverpool-leaf-tea-shop-harvest-sun-life-after-death.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAIRAAAQMDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEEgUGByExQVH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/8QAGREAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxEh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCe7+XdwPM2N3p4ZsltBxOIKlpJwJyiR3AI7nz9Fb6OctWZSG1aXaOFAxK1rVKo9mOppSjNjYOxiihsAn//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282746416,"updatedAt":1588403524720,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"2013/11/deptford-goth-union-liverpool-leaf-tea-shop-harvest-sun-life-after-death.jpg","categories":["music","remixes","new"]}
