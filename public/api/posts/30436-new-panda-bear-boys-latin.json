Directed by Isaiah Saxon and Sean Hellfritsch from Encyclopedia Pictura in San Francisco, the film is a psychadelic tripfest. Encyclopedia Pictura are the same guys to bring us video’s for <a href=\"https://ghostrobot.com/portfolio/metronomy-the-upsetter/\">Metronomy’s ‘The Upsetter’</a>, <a href=\"https://ghostrobot.com/portfolio/bjork-wanderlust/\">Bjork’s ‘Wanderlust’</a> and the magnificent <a href=\"https://ghostrobot.com/portfolio/grizzly-bear-knife/\">‘Knife’ by Grizzly Bear</a></p>\n<p>In a press release from Domino Records, director Isaiah Saxon said: <em>“We tried hard to bring out the vibe of that alternating melody that Noah is singing. We wondered what that should look and feel like from a synesthesia perspective. We’ve always believed that shapes and forms themselves have emotional meaning. For example, round things are often cute and non-threatening, while spiky things usually seem dangerous. We ran with that idea by creating these dynamic forms that grow out of our characters as they deal with their emotions.”</em></p>\n<p>Panda Bear has also launched a <a href=\"https://www.pbvsgr.com/\">creepy looking website </a> to promote his fifth studio album and has a string of upcoming European tour dates. Shows kick off in London on the 4th of March and finishing in Portugal on the 12th.
