Equal parts elegant and ferocious; showcasing the pinnacle of their songwriting thus far, it’s easy to see why they’re winning over fans in colossal numbers on both sides of the Atlantic. With official remixes for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ic8U0MRHGM\" target=\"_blank\">Gaga</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnrfTPoYqKo\" target=\"_blank\">Imagine Dragons</a> under their belts, alongside a mightily impressive live show, Lovelife look set to grab hold of 2014 in a way that few bands have done thus far.
