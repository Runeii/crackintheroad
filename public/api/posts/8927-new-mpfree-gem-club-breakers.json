With their debut LP of the same title set to be released later in the year via <a href=\"https://www.hardlyart.com/\">Hardly Art</a>, and a rapidly expanding following eagerly anticipating it’s arrival; it’s set to be a hectic year for <strong>Gem Club</strong>. The piano driven “Breakers” is hauntingly heartwrenching, nervously shuffling in somewhere between<strong> Youth Lagoon </strong>and <strong>Perfume Genius</strong>, and expertly utilizing the soft yet piercing vocals of Christopher Barnes. Being the first new material since last year’s EP <em>Acid and Everything</em>, this melancholic track has been met with stunning reviews, cementing the two-piece as a real talent to watch out for. Check it out below, and head over to their bandcamp to download “Breakers” for free.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2172625962/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"8927-new-mpfree-gem-club-breakers","category":"music","date":1309462915000,"wpid":8927,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/06/gclp-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQFB//EACMQAAEDAgUFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQAEQUGEkFREyQyQnH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANuzBKLMkEyAySm6dToQBb7Q3mCCW0lbg12F7HepWfozEhzDzIYadIuAVoCtxzTbEON0G+3Z8R6DiqP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294253219,"updatedAt":1588403553497,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/gclp-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
