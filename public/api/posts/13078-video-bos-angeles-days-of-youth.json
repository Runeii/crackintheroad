Comprised of plenty of psychedelic colours, leftover Halloween masks and a disjointed car ride, it’s bizarrely adorable. Having heard <em>Days Of Youth</em> several months back, it’s great to see the group trying their hand at putting visuals to their sultry music, with the track in question being two minutes and nineteen seconds of ball-bustingly catchy indie pop. I’m not entirely sure as to the concept behind the video, whatever, it’s freaking fun, check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_AcStGvrZ0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13078-video-bos-angeles-days-of-youth","category":"music","date":1323734016000,"wpid":13078,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":493,"src":"2011/12/337850_319224878106430_226821824013403_1301280_522618468_o-950x493.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAHRABAAEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxESEyFBkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAGBEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDITH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANwtWyzpB5Mq4k2zS91exEnxWvQcus//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293274838,"updatedAt":1588443776823,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/12/337850_319224878106430_226821824013403_1301280_522618468_o-950x493.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
