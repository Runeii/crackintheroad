How To Dress Well","content":"<p>A brand new cut from the new <strong>Shlohmo</strong> EP, <em>Laid Out</em>, and featuring <strong>How To Dress Well</strong> no less, not a bad thing to wake up to.</p><p> As expected with such a featuring credit , <em>Don’t Say No</em> is noticeably more minimal than the blistering first effort from the EP. This cut however still has an element of malice that left such a wonderfully sour taste in the mouth after listening to debut track, <em>Later.</em></p>\n<p>Hit play below and look out for the full EP on March 5.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F79869359\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19894-new-shlohmo-dont-say-no-ft-how-to-dress-well","category":"music","date":1361258491000,"wpid":19894,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283934055,"updatedAt":1588441770197,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/dd18c6d5e5631e4179f5154b44bbb2aa80348302.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
