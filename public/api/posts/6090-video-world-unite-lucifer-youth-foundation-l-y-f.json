As well as releasing this video yesterday, they also announced details of their debut album, titled Go Tell Fire To The Mountain, released on 13/6/11. It is believed that L Y F will be the first official single from their debut LP, and it’s not a bad way to announce yourselves. The song itself makes use of their elaborate semi-screamed vocal parts, with the refrain “I’ll love you forever!” forming the focal point of the track. Oh and stay with it to the end of the track to see a clip taken from one of Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s infamous hilarious interviews.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QWxviSD79c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"6090-video-world-unite-lucifer-youth-foundation-l-y-f","category":"music","date":1301489984000,"wpid":6090,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":561,"height":419,"src":"2011/06/wu-lyf-2.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAhEAACAQIGAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAwIAEQQFBgcSIRMxQf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAGREBAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACIRHw/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCahr56chzAYWTiiMIwj5Cedrd8jfs3NTSt0tUKXBasesLgBGIK/g9UpVNgQyN7Vz2T/9k="},"createdAt":1587294569655,"updatedAt":1588403558033,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/wu-lyf-2.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
