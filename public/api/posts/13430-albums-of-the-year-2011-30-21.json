Gone are the straggly, grunge inspired live instrumentation of his debut, replaced with slick electronics and production to emphasise the strong pop- melodies on display. So there was ‘no generation-defining anthems, no radical new approach to songwriting, no active rejection of genre distinctions’ (fuck off), but to criticise this is to forget <strong>Vek</strong> and his album’s point. From the wonderfully catchy <em>A Chore</em>, to the closing drawl of <em>Too Bad</em>, this was an album designed to be one thing: tight fun.

This remarkable level of modesty is at odds with the critical acclaim to which <em><strong>Strange Mercy</strong></em> was met with, and rightly so as <strong>Clark</strong> has created a record that is a beautiful tapestry of musical genius and cryptic intimacy.

Gone are the wavering, barely in-tune synth lines and ‘bedroom-produced’ instrumentation that made <strong>Nights Out</strong>, instead replaced with slick, grooving bass lines; warm, saccharine electronics and actual well-sung by actual real people vocal harmonies. What’s more, the changes created one of the best indie-dancefloor filler tracks of the year, in The Bay.

It’s a mellower offering than much of the band’s previous output, but the strength of songwriting on <em><strong>Nine Types of Light</strong></em> puts paid to the outcries of any Touch & Go purists.

Showcasing ‘chillwave’ at it’s utmost elegant and stimulating, <strong>Washed Out</strong> have also worked tirelessly to translate the album to the live circuit. Album closer <em>A Dedication</em> also proved to be one of the highlights of the year, and perhaps hinting at a future direction for <strong>Greene</strong>.

No, it’s not original or clever, and whether anyone will even remember it in another year’s time is debatable, but it is packed to bursting with slackerly sunshine, and drenched in a thick layer of sludge that sticks around longer than it’s often given credit for.

The clue’s in the name of course, but while <em><strong>Slave Ambient</strong></em> can seem unremarkable at first, it unfurls beautifully on repeated spins. <em>Best Night</em> and <em>Baby Missiles</em> cater for the fist-pumpers, while the gorgeous, rolling <em>I Was There</em> pisses all over anything Ryan Adams did last year. Music for those who’d rather gaze at the horizon than their feet.
