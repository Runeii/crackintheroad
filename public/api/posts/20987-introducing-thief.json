With their combo of debut tracks,<em> Friend/Lover</em> and <em>Satine Repeat</em> before released earlier today, their sound is slick, reassuring simplistic yet wonderfully effective. Satine Repeat touches on deep-house elements, whilst Friend/Lover could well be the track to shot them to blog fame. Check out both below.</p>\n<p>“<em>don’t wanna be your friend / I wanna be your lover</em>”</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2531456320/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3396010093/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20987-introducing-thief","category":"introducing","date":1365624344000,"wpid":20987,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":936,"height":648,"src":"2013/04/3458310105-1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAgIBBQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhESIRRx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANBO99xF94Jc0H54akogikrXQ0h5Zk7qGIHir245X3zLnQt0NY0TT5rNN1nkrxvIC4JDFQT7+4xgf//Z"},"createdAt":1587283634935,"updatedAt":1588403531308,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/04/3458310105-1.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
