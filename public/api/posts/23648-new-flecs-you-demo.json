Now, flexing his own muscles on his debut solo track, a demo titled <em>You</em>, released under the moniker <strong>Flecs</strong>, it’s a mix between the dancefloor ready pop of <strong>Disclosure</strong>, and the dreamier, bedroom based ‘chillwave’, that’s become increasingly popular as of late, yet done with a composure and elegance that makes it more than worthwhile. With the pattern at the moment being to team up with vocalists, and with the quality of<em> You</em>, I’d imagine <strong>Flecs</strong> will have potential collaborators queuing up before too long.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F103755026\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23648-new-flecs-you-demo","category":"music","date":1375536004000,"wpid":23648,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/08/artworks-000054393194-6w6pi2-t500x500.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQMG/8QAJhAAAQMBBQkAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABAwQFBhITIREjJDFSgZGSof/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhUf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AyFHdsnpsRyU5E+u3GXLtojXsORnfiIPqLGaXLLeH7Op5h9ZeUCnRqP/Z"},"createdAt":1587283163519,"updatedAt":1588403528187,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/artworks-000054393194-6w6pi2-t500x500.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
