Heavily 60’s inspired, it’s slightly melancholic indie pop at it’s realest, like a UK version of <strong>Coma Cinema</strong>; play it to your girlfriend and watch as she swoons.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F51849198&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17182-new-an-blonds-currents","category":"music","date":1341512741000,"wpid":17182,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284978107,"updatedAt":1587825890290,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","new"]}
