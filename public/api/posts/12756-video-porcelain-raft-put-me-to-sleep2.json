The set, for want of a better phrase, was ‘fucking fantasic’, with <strong>Mauro Remiddi </strong>leaving the crowds’ jaws literally hanging in the now legendary London space.</p>\n<p>Since then, he’s been picked up by <strong>Secretly Canadian</strong>, has an album due out early next year and most importantly, he’s still making damagingly emotionally music. His new video sees Remiddi drowning in a bath of milk. It’s a humbling and uncomfortable watch.</p>\n<p><em>Strange Weekend</em> comes out through Secretly Canadian on January 24th.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/31210415?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"12756-video-porcelain-raft-put-me-to-sleep2","category":"music","date":1321948840000,"wpid":12756,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":92,"src":"2011/11/porcelain-raft-putmetosleep-165x92.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAHxAAAgICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwUREiEiMUHB/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAX/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDDGWm3HK1PJX5AbYDod6+y4ZuykCpQ2k7R49REIW2lUzp//9k="},"createdAt":1587293413087,"updatedAt":1588443777359,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/11/porcelain-raft-putmetosleep-165x92.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
