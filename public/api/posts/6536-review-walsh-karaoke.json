Combining elements of shoe-gaze, hip-hop and chill wave it ultimately formed a reverberating synths laden delight. Its main strength was its want and need to experiment. No one tune clung to a particular theme or style, yet the record as a whole still managed to cling to a sound. In this case: thoughts of a damaged metropolis.</p>\n<p>Despite the genre jumping, each tune on the EP worked when compared to one another, in many ways they still do with his new record <em>KARAOKE</em>. The sound is still more focused but bizarrely loses the wonder that made his last EP a joy to listen to. The low-fi grooves are still interesting and Walsh can undoubtedly get your head bopping quicker and for longer than most, yet it all seems like a well-trodden formula.</p>\n<p><em>Birthday Girl</em> and <em>Dark Future </em>are two tracks that embrace the free-form personality of the last EP but as obnoxious as it sounds, the rest of the record comes across as lo-fi Justice B-sides, leaving the EP feeling mundane.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2323207490/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"6536-review-walsh-karaoke","category":"music","date":1302801144000,"wpid":6536,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/04/walsh-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAGxAAAwADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRBiH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFBv/EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMkKB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDP5G9U39lkrRWEbcIYgj5lbMZJsVVZoqhyAAoAA7jGPWZTqbw//9k="},"createdAt":1587294518672,"updatedAt":1588443778788,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/04/walsh-292x50.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
