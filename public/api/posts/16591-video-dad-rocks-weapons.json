Let’s take the last song on his debut full-length, <strong><em>Mount Modern</em></strong>. It’s called <em>Pants</em>. Albertsson plays vulnerable at first, cooing the knocks to one’s self-worth that fatherhood can present – <em>“And then you’re covered in shit/And you don’t think that you are fit/to be raising a kid” </em>– before qualifying this with <em>“that gets to suck on all the tits”.</em>  That’s kind of how Dad Rocks!, er, rolls. <em></em></p>\n<p>The video for <em>Weapons </em>plays out as a cheerfully observed, self-effacing snippet of the vagaries of indie-rock fandom. I have been this video’s protagonist so many times that I’m not sure whether to laugh (I did), cry (I haven’t…yet), or further perpetuate the stereotype by sitting on my floor listening to headphones surrounded by my records (I’m working on it). My favourite bits are the 2 seconds that Jeniferever’s <strong><em>Choose A Bright Morning </em></strong>makes it into shot, Snævar trying to pass himself off as less enthusiastic than someone else, and every shot where the nerdy protagonist throws his arms into the air in utter, arcing-heart joy at experiencing Dad Rocks! related material. So, yeah, the whole video.</p>\n<p>This Friday (so 25th May 2012), Dad Rocks! are headlining a <a title=\"Want to meet Rob Hollamby, legendary writer for shit hot music blog Crack in the Road?
