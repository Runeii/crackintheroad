Adding his stereotypically expansive sound and synth inspired drawl, <strong>S.Maharba</strong> leaves the vocals relatively intact, yet thrashes the rest of the track into a gloriously, almost unrecognizable mess. With more original material on the way, 2012 is shaping up rather nicely for the producer.</p>\n<p>Check out <strong>S.Maharba’s</strong> <em>Night In The Ocean (S.Maharba Serpent Love Song Remix) </em>below, and grab a listen of <strong>Young Magic’s</strong> debut album <strong><em>Melt</em></strong> which comes out tomorrow.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36501094&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14962-new-young-magic-night-in-the-ocean-s-maharba-serpent-love-song-remix","category":"music","date":1329158357000,"wpid":14962,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292847510,"updatedAt":1587825902529,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","remixes","new"]}
