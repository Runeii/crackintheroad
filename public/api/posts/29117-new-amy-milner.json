But, this little gem that popped into my inbox a week or so ago is for when all the  craziness is done with and all the mud has been washed from your face. <em>Have It All</em>, the new track from U.K songstress <strong>Amy Milner</strong> is a gorgeous piano ballad, with subtly placed electronics scattered throughout, drawing you in and bringing you back to earth. Perfect for sitting in the back garden with (a lot less) beer in hand, staring at the sun.</p>\n<p>Stream <em>Have It All</em> below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/155356903&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29117-new-amy-milner","category":"music","date":1405672463000,"wpid":29117,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282046425,"updatedAt":1588441756002,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"generated/cfc2fb055bfb645cd7e929e0f224f402f1c4fa02.jpg","categories":["music","newnews"]}
