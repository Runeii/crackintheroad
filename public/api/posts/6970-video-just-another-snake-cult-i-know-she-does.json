On Thursday he released the video for his newest single I Know She Does, three minutes of indie pop perfection. Influences for the track are easy to spot, with the likes of The Smiths and Pale Saints, amongst numerous shoegaze bands appearing to inform his work, as well as more modern artists like The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart and The Drums. The video itself is bizarre yet engaging, blurred shots of Thor singing, mixed with lyrics from the track scrawled over the top of the images, leaves the viewer confused yet temporarily mesmerized. I Know She Does is taken from an EP comprised of demo’s and outtakes, which can be downloaded <a href=\"https://justanothersnakecult.bandcamp.com/album/ghosts\">here</a>, or alternatively watch the video below.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRH2ECjUnlw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"6970-video-just-another-snake-cult-i-know-she-does","category":"music","date":1303588691000,"wpid":6970,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":680,"height":342,"src":"2011/04/she-does.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUI/8QAHBAAAgIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEQMSIQSh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAAL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANLY6Gd/ExZhmGR99uqLHPsoqoVQvTQqzERdATEbd//Z"},"createdAt":1587294470755,"updatedAt":1588403556704,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/04/she-does.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
