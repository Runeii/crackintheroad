Take the seven minute epic <em>Solarize</em>, a tune so insanely danceable yet managing to remain intriguing on an emotional level, combining the elegance of <strong>Washed Out</strong> with the ear for a hook possessed by the likes of <strong>Ou Est Le Swimming Pool</strong>.</p>\n<p>It’s refreshing to learn that I’m not the only one who has picked up on the genius of <strong>Outside</strong>, with him (them?) set to open for <strong>Unknown Mortal Orchestra</strong> at Mohawk on Sunday. You can guarantee that whilst this might be the first you hear of <strong>Outside</strong>, it certainly won’t be the last.</p>\n<p>There’s splashes of 80’s inspiration throughout <strong>Puma Punk</strong>, no more so than on the delightfully erotic<em> Honey Thief</em>, that might just be the sort of music <strong>Bowie</strong> would be producing, had he had the leisure of modern equipment. It’s fairly unrelenting as a listen, yet is all the more stimulating for it. Despite having played the full release through several times, I still feel there’s greater depth to <em><strong>Puma Punk</strong></em> than it initially divulges, and it’ll probably be several more listens before I fully understand the depth of the record.
