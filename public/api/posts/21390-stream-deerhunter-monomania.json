Still, it’s a new Deerhunter album, which is always an exciting prospect and it’ll be interesting to see how <em>Monomania</em>, which, for all those who are curious, means a “pathological obsession with one idea or subject”, will hold up after a couple of listens.</p>\n<p>The album is released on the 6th May by the lovely folks over at 4AD. You can hear <em>Monomania </em>via NPR First Listen <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/04/21/177759938/first-listen-deerhunter-monomania\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
