Instantly engaging, the track then builds into a blossoming pop frenzy, as additional percussion is introduced and classic pop melodies are translated into infectious piano and synth lines.</p>\n<p>It is very easy to imagine ‘Marisol’ as an anthemic hit, cut as a three minute gem that balances a fine set of dynamics that allow for moments of calming rest bite and shocks of effervescent euphoria. Though they may have flown under the radar of most ‘One’s to Watch’ lists, we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on April Towers in 2014.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/121026763\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24987-new-april-towers-marisol","category":"music","date":1384953385000,"wpid":24987,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282756096,"updatedAt":1588441761003,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/65c1b29b88d4ec8f7a435eee720d9fc9861f2f96.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
