I find it impossible to take any kind of issue with a rap song that samples Yuck though and I do adore the fact that Heems, most likely deliberately, is messing with the public’s expectations just for lulz.</p>\n<p>Heems has a tour of the UK planned soon, details of which you can find <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19462-news-first-uk-solo-show-for-heems-since-das-racist-breakup/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
