I don’t know much about the young producer but I do know he’s Glaswegian, he <a title=\"Harvey Kartel - Bandcamp\" href=\"https://harveykartel.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">seems to like dinosaurs</a> (my kinda guy), and he’s called Deaglán Duffy. When he’s creating melodic synth melodies adorning hip-hop-oriented beats, you can’t help compare him to fellow Scot <strong>Hudson Mohawke</strong>.</p>\n<p>There’s something a bit different going on here though. I can say that here is a new producer with a lot of promise and potential in terms of sonic diversity – there are a few routes this guy could go. For instance, with the snippet of <em>Astounding Weird</em>, there’s a lot of high-pitched, oscillating squelch, which harks back to the schizophrenic highs-and-lows of producers like <strong>dÉbruit</strong> and <strong>Slugabed</strong> – yet listen to another clip, such as <em>Matinee</em>, and you have something completely different. Shuffling rave drums, hollow knocks of percussion to shifting time patterns, tied neatly together with choppy synth and vocals, reminiscent of recent European producers like <strong>Teeth</strong> and <strong>BNJMN</strong>.</p>\n<p>The track that caught my attention, though, was his most recently posted. It’s also the most ambitious and grandiose I’ve come across, and I hope it projects him forward. <strong>Numbers</strong> or <strong>LuckyMe</strong>, if you’re listening – pick this boy up now:</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Trillicious below, and check out his <a title=\"Harvey Kartel - SoundCloud\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/harveykartel\" target=\"_blank\">SoundCloud</a> for more.</em></p>\n<p><center><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25989303&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25989303&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></center></p>\n","slug":"12406-introducing-harvey-kartel","category":"introducing","date":1320864653000,"wpid":12406,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293520895,"updatedAt":1587825911208,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","categories":["introducing","music"]}
