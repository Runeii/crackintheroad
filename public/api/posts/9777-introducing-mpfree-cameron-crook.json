Blue flashes of tram lines shaking in the distance. I’m alone. It’s nights like this I play the music of Cameron Crook.</p>\n<p>Despite a a lot of electronic input Cameron’s music is incomprehensibly organic. A  trip hop influenced tapestry of glitch beats, samples and guitar. Years ago at a tiny pub in Chorley, I remember hearing Cameron playing a gig under the moniker of We Don’t Know Who You Are Anymore. The place was full of the wrong crowd but the music sounded so right. Instrumental and influential, pulsing crescendos pair up with lo-fi moments of tranquility.</p>\n<p>Cameron Crook’s newest release ‘The Nettle Patch’ blends field recordings, live instruments and samples into tracks, beautiful on their own and magical together. When I moved into this apartment, people asked me why I’d want live on my own. Cameron’s music answers the question – we all have to be alone sometimes. I don’t necessarily mean that in a depressing way, open a window, turn up your speakers, hit play and see what I mean.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4199397171/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=7/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"https://camerontcrook.bandcamp.com/album/the-nettle-patch\">The Nettle Patch by Cameron Crook</a></iframe></p>\n<p>Cameron Crook was kind enough to let Crack in The Road give away this track as a mpfree, download it <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2011/08/Cameron-Crook-The-Nettle-Patch-07-Nettles.mp3\">here</a>.
