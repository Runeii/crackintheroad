So, here you go <strong>Patrick Daugherty</strong>, I’m writing about your music.</p>\n<p>Hailing from Jacksonville, Florida, I presume that <strong>Patrick Daugherty’s</strong> music is entirely a solo venture, with his new release Conscience being his debut outing (another assumption). It’s a hugely appealing collection of deeply personal tracks, ranging from Why-esque folk-rap (<em>The Passage Of Rip Van Winkle</em>) to piano led instrumental ballad (<em>Prospering Emotions</em>). The production is purposefully raw, yet it goes without saying that due to the nature of the tracks, they benefit from minimal tampering.</p>\n<p><strong>Daughterty</strong> really excels on the release’s final two tracks, with<em> I Don’t Know</em> slipping in somewhere between modern pop and 00’s American indie and the instrumental closer <em>Prospering Emotions</em> showcasing the singer at his most refined. It’s a collection of tracks full of immense promise, and definitely a work for<strong> Daugherty</strong> to take pride in and for us to admire.
