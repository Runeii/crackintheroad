Well, apparently I have now. And whilst it might seem a bit short sighted to have decided this already, someone is going to have to pull a bloody miracle out their arse to even think of making me reconsider. I just like <em><strong>The Wages of Fear</strong></em> that much. <em>Edith</em>, like the majority of the record’s twelve tracks, is a clever, expertly handled guitar pop song that takes in <strong>The Weakerthans </strong>and spits them propulsively out in a hail of unfinished novels and the disenchantment of young adulthood. Recontextualising those crises adherent to your early twenties with the life and times of an early 20th century author? Doing it all to a song that could have even the most flint-hearted bastard punching the air, at least in secret? A lucha libre themed video?! Yes fuckin’ please.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Wages of Fear </em></strong>is out now on <a title=\"Ooh, he's been a bit cheeky there...\" href=\"https://www.naimlabel.com/recording-the-wages-of-fear.aspx\">Naim Edge</a> records, and <em>Edith </em>is due out October 10th.
