Opening with a chorus of violins and an epic choir, the trailer soon descends into a<strong> Skrillex</strong> style dubstep number, possibly hinting at a future direction for the group.</p>\n<p>The group began recording in September last year and have apparently been working with <strong>David Campbell</strong>, who has previously pulled the strings for<strong> Adele</strong>, <strong>Radiohead</strong> and <strong>Beck</strong> amongst others. It remains to be seen whether this ‘Musestep’ (as one fan affectionately titled it) will form the basis for<em><strong> The 2nd Law</strong></em>; but judging by the trailer, here’s hoping it’s not.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqFZGnfMLMw\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16817-news-muse-announce-new-album-the-2nd-law","category":"music","date":1338985671000,"wpid":16817,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285137425,"updatedAt":1588441777229,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/12450535621500d6e519275f2c52d49c00a0168f.jpg","categories":["music","news"]}
