With an <a href=\"https://lectures.bandcamp.com/album/morning-come-quickly\" target=\"_blank\">album/extended EP</a> of sorts released last year, which definitely has it’s moments (<em>Uncall</em> especially), they’ve returned with their cleanest and most complete track to date in the form of the epic <em>Talking In A Vacuum</em>, mixing despairingly honest lyricism, with the sort of epic build that post-rock bands the world over would kill for. This is (at times) the sort of epic songwriting that has A&Rs dreaming of main stage festival slots, and without disrespecting their previous material, this almost feels like a band taking a deep breath, and stepping back out in the world, fresh faced and ready to go. Check out Talking In A Vacuum below, alongside Uncall.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/166031615&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/107191174&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29723-new-lectures-talking-vacuum","category":"music","date":1409780425000,"wpid":29723,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":100,"height":100,"src":"2014/09/10636957_853936677958440_4022159624447244715_o-100x100.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUG/8QAJBAAAgEDAgYDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQhBREGEhMxQmFBQ1H/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBv/EAB0RAAICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMxBAURIZH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM7NcXOoXEEck84hV1XceTAds4zV7o2n2Wd8X8iGQbn5wWxTOHkRdf1NFVQqT86gDAb9Hv3QJo0aVyyKSWJJI70DTlrF5LGU+4mumwIqDAx0PBP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587281928032,"updatedAt":1588403515528,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/09/10636957_853936677958440_4022159624447244715_o-100x100.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
