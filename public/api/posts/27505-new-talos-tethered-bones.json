Damn. Anyway, <strong>Talos</strong> need little introduction; the project of Eoin French (Hush War Cry) featuring production from Ian Ring (Young Wonder), their debut track,<em> Tethered Bones</em> is slides in somewhere between James Blake and SOHN. Four minutes and twenty seconds of absolute bliss. This is one of the tracks of the year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138132034&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27505-new-talos-tethered-bones","category":"music","date":1395423846000,"wpid":27505,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282331447,"updatedAt":1588441759957,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/07df718b4507344b8350f6320a7307dda20df89b.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
