{"id":"5e9c02ae774c2610387e49e6","artists":["5e9b69447a1236eccfeb2571"],"title":"New: St. Vincent — Digital Witness","content":"<p><strong>Annie Clark</strong> just dropped her second track off of her upcoming album, set for release in late February.</p><p> The new single has elements similar to that of the first single <em>Birth in Reverse</em> in that both contain features typical of Clark, but depart in ways that offer something fresh. The first thing one notices at first listen of <em>Digital Witness</em> is the funky beat that remains constant throughout and there is also an element of soul in Clark’s voice. The feisty nature of <strong>St. Vincent</strong> remains intact as she demands the attention of her listeners from the very beginning (“Get back in your seats, I want all of your mind”), through a song that may well be a critique of the digital obsessive age (“People turn on their tv, it looks just like a window”). With each track released, the anticipation builds further for St. Vincent’s upcoming fourth record.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-7LsBjrqqHA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25821-new-st-vincent-digital-witness","category":"music","date":1389041463000,"wpid":25821,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":628,"height":346,"src":"2014/01/screen-shot-2014-01-06-at-4.02.16-pm.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAsElEQVR4nDXJuw6CMBQA0E4mBqMhRjG8e5UEA0ilpS0gocgrOhgHBjf//y+cPOtBIEc3a8xLuQ3IxotwKjCpbFJjfj8WA8JycFljXiojpLKdpsczpKVzrX2m4N/KiORZqM/8/s6vmJdWUrhMgewRFqPPlJPIlRVInrciW+rGIaTA71h0yOM9MAUx13ASlV3EioUBkAifKj9vkZd3NrnpEK+P6Z62elxobrg7pTapPap+YewhAZyIj3gAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"createdAt":1587282606957,"updatedAt":1588403522544,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d2f","old_image":"2014/01/screen-shot-2014-01-06-at-4.02.16-pm.png","categories":["music","new"]}
