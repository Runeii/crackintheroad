On the flip side, <em>Float</em> is an almost dubstep inspired affair, again using a similar technique with the looped vocals, playing upon the repetitive nature and minimal atmosphere. Check out both cuts below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"355\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 355px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=673311227/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://comodo.bandcamp.com/album/havana-float\">Havana/Float by Comodo</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15703-new-comodo-havana-float","category":"mpfree","date":1332198196000,"wpid":15703,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292646282,"updatedAt":1588441779878,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/54f71b9338d1f944e273346a3cba8c03e84edba3.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
