Having just announced the release of sophomore album Portamento set to drop in September, they’ve also made the first single Money available for streaming.</p>\n<p>It’s another track that painstakingly sticks to their influences, in this case being hugely inspired by The Smiths. The vocals are languid and almost lazy in delivery, and the subject matter is melancholic in tone, with lead singer Johnny Pierce bemoaning ‘I want to buy you something, but I don’t have any money’. It’s joyfully energetic and a welcome return.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18885802\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18885802\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/workit/the-drums-money\">The Drums – Money</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/workit\">WorkItMedia</a></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"9142-review-the-drums-money","category":"music","date":1310590520000,"wpid":9142,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/07/46856027_drums_512288-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQH/8QAJBAAAgAEBgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFBhESEzFhByFBUXL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABgRAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCvx9j673+8XeTdAshd5KnVStpKmWctrngqPf3G9Nc5AYgoAfzA1rCZTzDKOgtisI2n1muXB66hPVrMKyeAxy3G+e4jbiDyF//Z"},"createdAt":1587294215482,"updatedAt":1588403552831,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/07/46856027_drums_512288-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
