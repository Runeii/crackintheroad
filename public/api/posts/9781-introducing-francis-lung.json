The sombre organs are displaced by lightly plucked guitars, making for an entirely different listening experience. Of the demos found on <strong>Francis Lung’s</strong><a href=\"https://francislung.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> tumblr</a>, the highlights are the thoughtful ballad of <em>Brooklyn Girls</em> and the slightly more upbeat <em>Keep It Brave</em>. With these songs, Tom McClung adds a much welcome element of diversity to the <strong>WU LYF</strong> sound, one which will hopefully be developed over the coming months. Check out <em>Brooklyn Girls</em> below.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F19968357\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F19968357\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/pmwtumblr/wu-lyf-brooklyn-girls\">WU LYF – Brooklyn Girls</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/pmwtumblr\">pmwtumblr</a></span> </p>\n","slug":"9781-introducing-francis-lung","category":"music","date":1313065355000,"wpid":9781,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294104552,"updatedAt":1588441788693,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/5a7822bd4968568bce8da4cc2c24fec9891386ad.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
