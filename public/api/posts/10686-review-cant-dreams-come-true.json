Whilst many artists thrive under the pretense of their parent project, <strong>CANT</strong> could possibly do without the <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong> name being branded across it, as with <em><strong>Dreams Come True</strong></em>, <strong>Taylor</strong> has fashioned an adorably charming and sonically pleasing record.</p>\n","slug":"10686-review-cant-dreams-come-true","category":"album-reviews","date":1316111133000,"wpid":10686,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/grizzly_bear_feature1-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587293854213,"updatedAt":1588403547982,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/09/grizzly_bear_feature1-165x165.jpg","categories":["album-reviews","music"]}
