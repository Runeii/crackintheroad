Their most recent effort, <em>Hello,</em> is part Black Keys, part Arctic Monkeys and exudes a confidence and immediacy that Marc Bolan would be proud of. Its crunching guitars sear through the mix and envelop the snarling, nasal twang of the lead vocals, a sound that will not leave your head all that quickly.</p>\n<p>Stream Hello below which was released November 28th via Dead Beet Records.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/174641174&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30247-new-jim-valentine-hello","category":"music","date":1418212827000,"wpid":30247,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":640,"src":"2014/11/10402822_848400995210209_3988471309048388192_n1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUI/8QAHhAAAgICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQRBRMhMXH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Aztj1ZHIYb9NQNSKCxLDQPyTzaUJXXrxEQP/Z"},"createdAt":1587281795038,"updatedAt":1588403513730,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"2014/11/10402822_848400995210209_3988471309048388192_n1.jpg","categories":["music","newnews"]}
