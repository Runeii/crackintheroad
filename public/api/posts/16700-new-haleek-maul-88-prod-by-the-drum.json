Each artist also sports a remarkable level of maturity, not that I’m trying to be patronizing, more that their ability to explore concepts to the same level as their seemingly elderly counter-parts, is at the very least notable.</p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"New: Haleek Maul X Supreme Cuts – Gully\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/16282-new-haleek-maul-x-supreme-cuts-gully/\">Haleek Maul</a></strong> is yet another artist who’s name has been the subject of endless blog posts, ours included. In no uncertain terms, in this case it’s kind of justified. <strong>Haleek</strong> spits like a young man not trying to emulate maturity, but more like a young man already drowned in the pains of maturity. Sex, relationships, death and Maul’s bubbling disturbing unconsciousness, all become mediums for expressing discomfort and anxiety. At times it’s eye-widening in the most grotesque and disturbing of ways, but it’s always engrossing.</p>\n<p>I’ll say it again; the most exciting thing I’ve heard all year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F47949523&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16700-new-haleek-maul-88-prod-by-the-drum","category":"music","date":1338333115000,"wpid":16700,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":620,"height":413,"src":"2012/05/haleek.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMI/8QAIxAAAQMDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAARIRIxBRQWIiNRUv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDPUxxmdxCOmOylt1awjULkXKsHPraq9Rct4DGbWWuzV9WxfalKD//Z"},"createdAt":1587286719358,"updatedAt":1588403538870,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/05/haleek.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
