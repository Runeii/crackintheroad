His remix of Cork based group <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/youngwondermusic\">Young Wonder</a></strong> and their track ‘<em>To You’</em>, is dramatically different, yet still retains the other worldly quality that made the original so exciting. Odd that I used the term ‘other worldly’ to describe a track that’s full to the brim with Indian samples, I’m not a xenophobe I promise. Anyway, before this article comes dangerously close to ‘life journalism’ or a therapy session, take a listen to the track.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F71111979\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18724-new-young-wonder-to-you-sacred-animals-remix","category":"music","date":1355494568000,"wpid":18724,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284342822,"updatedAt":1588441772548,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/607366bf996f59267ce6f41c132097e5732a8dc7.jpg","categories":["music","remixes"]}
