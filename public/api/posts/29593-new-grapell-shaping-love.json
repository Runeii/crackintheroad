Yet again marking them out as one of the most exciting Swedish acts around at this moment in time, it’ll be interesting to see where their forthcoming EP takes them.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/163653492&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29593-new-grapell-shaping-love","category":"music","date":1409134584000,"wpid":29593,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281957016,"updatedAt":1588441754565,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/94ad3a5860b841d2d510105d814eadde7918f53f.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
