Two favourites were Plaster of Paris & Wara.</p>\n<p>A full review of the festival along with some fantastic photographs will be online this week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/9581-big-chill-2011-new-music-festival-selection/attachment/popmolly/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-9902\"><img class=\"alignleft size-archives wp-image-9902\" title=\"PoPMolly\" src=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2011/08/PoPMolly-350x500.jpg\" alt=\"Plaster of Paris, Molly from the band\" width=\"192\" height=\"273\" /></a><strong> Plaster of Paris</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine if Zach Condon and Laura Marling had a baby, Plaster of Paris’ Molly Carroll would be their lovechild & thats not a statement to be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>Plaster of Paris are an infamous band, playing the festival circuit for years but remaining just out of the public eye. The london based band started off as a two piece, vocalist Molly Caroll & Lewis Jones on guitar, ukulele and an assortment of stringed instruments. The band now boasts six members providing an orchestral sound with an intimate closeness, incorporating cello, strings and booming Balkan percussion.</p>\n<p>We’ve searched high and low for information about this band but have found nothing since an outdated <a title=\"plaster of paris\" href=\"https://www.myspace.com/weareplasterofparis\">myspace page</a> & <a href=\"https://youtu.be/71zErnGdtJs\">amazing ICA performance</a> in 2008.

Wara blend <strong></strong>traditional <strong></strong>Cuban rhythmn and vocals with, <strong></strong>the rough flow of London grime..<strong></strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Saturday, their label Movimientos hosted an evening influenced by Latin culture in the Global <strong></strong>Local tent. I’d been in and out of the tent during the evening but the fucking energy of these guys kept me enthralled.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Wara is made up of a cornucopia of musicians originating from London to Cuba, mixing a <strong></strong>numb<strong></strong>er of Creolized styles with a unique urban vibe. Congolese-Argentinean Juanita Euka provides frantica lead vocals, whilst MC Josh ‘Murmur’ Solnic utilises the distinct sound of the UK’s capital, his lyrics almost a juxtapositon to the bright beats. The band sent a track from their upcoming EP which you can stream but I reckon you go down <a title=\"Passing Clouds Venue, London\" href=\"https://www.passingclouds.org/\">Passing Clouds</a>, 19th August and experience Wara’s amazing live performance.</p>\n<p><object width=\"50%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F19271888\" /><embed width=\"50%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F19271888\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/movimientos\">Wara – Flesh & Bone</a></span></p>\n","slug":"9581-big-chill-2011-new-music-festival-selection","category":"festivals","date":1313407997000,"wpid":9581,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/wara-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgUH/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIABBExAwUSIUFRof/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAHBEAAQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQADEgIEEWFx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDChT0rKXdVCBGUlS1+QwQPfySSO8xJUIq7RrcVUX1WHQ8XaHBgQt1Sz1V3TIahsAr/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294080922,"updatedAt":1588403550843,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d40","old_image":"2011/08/wara-165x165.jpg","categories":["festivals","music","reviews"]}
