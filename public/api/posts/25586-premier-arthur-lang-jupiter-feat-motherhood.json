Motherhood)","content":"<p>2013 has been one hell of a year for new music.</p><p> But for us guys at Crack In the Road the year is far from over and there’s an abundance of great music still yet to be discovered. Take this, the premiere of <strong>Arthur Lang</strong>‘s latest video <em>Jupiter</em>, featuring <strong>Motherhood</strong>.</p>\n<p>Arthur Lang, aka Birmingham based Andrew Halford, has previously collaborated with Yannis from <strong>Foals</strong>, as well as appearing alongside the likes of Ewan Pearson, Plaid and James Yuill. He looks set for a fantastic new year and this video, although slightly bizarre and <em>very</em> Grand Theft Auto, is the perfect demonstration of the guy’s talent.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXCZVZeltBo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25586-premier-arthur-lang-jupiter-feat-motherhood","category":"music","date":1387360835000,"wpid":25586,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282640973,"updatedAt":1588441760687,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d34","old_image":"2013/12/arthur-lang-press-shot-950x692.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
