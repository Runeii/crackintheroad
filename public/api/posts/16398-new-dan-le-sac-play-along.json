This is more than evident on the Twitter feed of overly-bearded UK rapper Scroobius Pip. He tweets a lot and, although I respect him as an artist, I am ambivalent towards the majority of his everyday whimsical thoughts – but such is the nature of the beast.</p>\n<p>However, I was recently rewarded for my loyalty in following him when, on the 2<sup>nd</sup> May, he announced that we could expect a forthcoming release from his multi-talented musical companion and ‘fellow DJ’ <strong>Dan Le Sac</strong>. After Scroobius Pip’s debut solo effort <strong><em>Distraction Pieces</em></strong>, it was welcome if unsurprising news that Dan Le Sac would also have something of his own devising in the pipeline too.</p>\n<p>The first single from the album offers us a fresh slice of juicy electro-pop with which to whet our appetites for what’s to come. <em>Play Along</em>, featuring the smooth attitude of Sarah Williams White, progresses through rolling urban lows and melodic bass-bouncing highs, building to an elated climax that will turn dance floors all over the country into choppy seas of gun-fingers. It’s vibrant, animated and there’s a lot of enjoyment to be had whether you’re at home, in a bass-drenched club or rolling down your car windows in a knowingly short sighted attempt to rock everyone’s world.</p>\n<p>The album, entitled <strong><em>Space Between the Words</em></strong> is out 9 July on <a href=\"https://www.sundaybest.net/artist/dan-le-sac/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunday Best</a>, and features appearances from Emmy the Great, Merz, and Pete Hefferan (of Pete and the Pirates) amongst others. With Dan Le Sac’s track record as it stands, and if <em>Play Along </em>is anything to go by, we can safely assume that the album will be as eclectic as it is delightful.</p>\n<p>For more information go to Dan Le Sac’s <a title=\"danlesac.co.uk\" href=\"https://www.danlesac.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, and make sure you check out <em>Play Along </em>below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F44391434&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16398-new-dan-le-sac-play-along","category":"music","date":1336468366000,"wpid":16398,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587289410674,"updatedAt":1588441778450,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d47","old_image":"2012/05/dan-le-sac-165x110.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
