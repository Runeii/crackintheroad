In her own words, “<em>I think that when the vices in life get to be too much it can be helpful to hit reset, and go back to the basics. For me, this song is about recognizing when things might be getting too heavy, and slowing down before you’re in over your head.</em>” Stick to Weed is well and truly the sound of a hugely confident artist hitting their stride.
