Whether it’s the lush instrumental of <em>omertá</em> or the cutting, cynicism of<em> stop pretending</em>, there’s more than enough in Dead Girlfriends to show that Brooks has far from drained of his creative talents. Check out the <em>stop pretending</em> EP below, including the best every use of the lyric ‘ugh’.</p>\n<p>you say you can’t be soft if you wanna be punk</p>\n<p>fine, cool, whatever, thanks for clearing that up</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 593px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3131248212/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23466-introducing-dead-girlfriends","category":"introducing","date":1375114827000,"wpid":23466,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1000,"height":1000,"src":"2013/07/a4233678441_10.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587283200868,"updatedAt":1588403528696,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/07/a4233678441_10.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
