It’s easy to get along with, and with a pallet of sounds that seems to have more than a little bit of longevity we’re pretty certain you’ll be hearing a lot more from her.</p>\n<p>Download the tune below and watch the track’s video while you’re at it.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1372033336/size=grande/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wp05cktNwFI\" height=\"315\" width=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20399-new-video-sww-close-to-the-equator","category":"music","date":1363102105000,"wpid":20399,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283772941,"updatedAt":1588441768475,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/a177469870b41f7e17e3b5f2156c1ab7a7e92df8.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews","videos"]}
