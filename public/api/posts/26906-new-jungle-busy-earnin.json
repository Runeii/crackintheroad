{"id":"5e9c01dd774c2610387e4836","artists":["5e9b690a7a1236eccfeb21d7"],"title":"New: JUNGLE – Busy Earnin’","content":"<p><strong>JUNGLE</strong> were possibly my favourite new band to emerge from 2013, and with their signing to illustrious label XL Recordings now confirmed, it’s clear that the only way is up.</p><p> Infectious hooks galore, and with an attitude to live performance that quite frankly puts most other artists to shame, they’re bold, innovative and deliriously fantastic. New single, <em>Busy Earnin’</em> picks up where the Chess Club Records EPs left off, with their 60’s soul meets early 90’s dance vibes. If there’s been a more downright enjoyable single released this year, then I’m yet to hear it.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135270855&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26906-new-jungle-busy-earnin","category":"music","date":1392848175000,"wpid":26906,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":520,"height":350,"src":"2014/02/be2gvofccaagedfbfad7f.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAHxAAAgAGAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFBhESITGS/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANvkNVmgyGXT2WnacvMh25SVHp10zeAEEaGyR3FsmzZ8JSB7nSlgo2eQ9+YQhImv/9k="},"createdAt":1587282397662,"updatedAt":1588403518752,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/02/be2gvofccaagedfbfad7f.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
