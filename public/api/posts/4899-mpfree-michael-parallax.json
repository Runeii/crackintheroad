This week, my explorations led me to the sounds of Michael Parallax from Gainesville in the USA, who creates elegantly laid back pop music. Whilst not having a huge internet presence at this moment in time, Michael Parallax has a phenomenal amount of music on his <a href=\"michael-parallax.bandcamp.com/ \">bandcamp site</a>, all on a pay as much as you like basis.</p>\n<p>Coming in somewhere between Casiotone For The Painfully Alone and How To Dress Well, it would be easy to categorize Parallax’s music as lo-fi, yet with further listens it’s clear there is far more going on underneath the surface. So far, I’ve listened to three of the seven releases up on his site, and the most accomplished work appears to be Mountain, his recent full length release. Personal highlight for me is the graceful Montana, with Parallax hauntingly weeping the key lyric – “I am happy, with your choices, but you kill me, before I fall asleep”. Anyway, technically you can download all these records for diddly squat, however, if you like the music then please support the artists.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"data\" value=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3382851541/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//\" /><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /><param name=\"allowNetworking\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"never\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3382851541/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3382851541/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" wmode=\"transparent\" allownetworking=\"always\" quality=\"high\" data=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3382851541/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//\"></embed></object></p>\n","slug":"4899-mpfree-michael-parallax","category":"music","date":1299008363000,"wpid":4899,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":450,"src":"2011/06/michael+parallax+playing.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAURBAYhMRMVIv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAdEQACAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwABEgQRMUGR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwC5drjbZtoQesjDy6uFZ5VKfSlcjgnpSrZxk8jrmsik3hY1kZWSQMCQR46UoHTJFpYFwNDt5HntJQ5D3dz/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294700276,"updatedAt":1588403559765,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/michael+parallax+playing.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
