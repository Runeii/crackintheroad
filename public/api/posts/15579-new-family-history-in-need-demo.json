Based around a simple chord progression and<strong> LCD Soundsystem’s</strong> guide to writing electro-pop classics, there’s a level of understanding found on <em>In Need</em> that’s warmly refreshing. “<em>All your friends are getting married and carried away”</em> laments the lead singer in a respectably honest fashion. Dance your heart out kid.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F38783334&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15579-new-family-history-in-need-demo","category":"music","date":1331402976000,"wpid":15579,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292692375,"updatedAt":1587825900185,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","new"]}
