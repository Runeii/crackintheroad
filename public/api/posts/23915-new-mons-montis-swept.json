There’s little information available online, except the names of the band members; Viktor Paulsrud, Herman Båverud Olsson and Julia Hjertström and the fact that they’re from Uppsala . Gorgeous female vocals and an addictive synth-hook, this trio are well worth four minutes of your time.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F105316088\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23915-new-mons-montis-swept","category":"mpfree","date":1376705893000,"wpid":23915,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/08/artworks-000055491163-84jbqg-t500x500.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwX/xAAiEAEAAgEDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMRAAQhBRITFCMxQbH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECACH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AGqr0G5sSbX5ZLiE0F5fjDzqzTbto01x9sxEMdzxxot3NcGu6tjFrhcyjHHEVXkPrSn00Hp21Uy+KH4aF0uuwHd//9k="},"createdAt":1587283064366,"updatedAt":1588403527034,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/artworks-000055491163-84jbqg-t500x500.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
