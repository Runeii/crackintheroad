Out of all those billions of versions of the 1984 shit-pop ‘classic’, this bluegrass take by Sweden’s <strong>The Linedance Fever</strong> may well be the best yet. The vocals are dark and delivered with meaning, and as a whole, it’s 50% bloody hilarious, 50% bloody brilliance. Just wait till it gets going; I wish I knew how to ‘jive’.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4094223403/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13338-new-the-linedance-fever-last-christmas-wham-cover","category":"mpfree","date":1324568126000,"wpid":13338,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":121,"src":"2011/12/399304_265392600180585_120352011351312_722340_1922870826_n-165x121.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIxAAAQMDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEBRIxBhQhIiNBgf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABADEy/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDO7lHD2Cx2bZySQ5dFSOWWhvyNPpSIbneO4yOg3B9VAuZG31q1XawZMgogj5FKUusnJf/Z"},"createdAt":1587293186938,"updatedAt":1588403543682,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/12/399304_265392600180585_120352011351312_722340_1922870826_n-165x121.jpg","categories":["mpfree","news","music"]}
