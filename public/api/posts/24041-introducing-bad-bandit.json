Mixing elements of <strong>S O H N’s</strong> luxurious, beat-orientated ‘sadcore’ and the dreaded ‘chillwave’, it’s a stunningly reassured release. Opening with the vocal loop of <em>Ghosts</em>, that slips effortlessly into a six minute epic, it’s a beautiful EP, thoroughly deserving of the praise that will undoubtedly be thrown it’s way. Check out Conifer below, including my personal favourite, Okay.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 593px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1784582111/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24041-introducing-bad-bandit","category":"introducing","date":1378040952000,"wpid":24041,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283033408,"updatedAt":1588441762974,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/57145ff4b0b22b44deee5720584b151cecb192f5.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
