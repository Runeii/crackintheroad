Taking vocals from the chorus of the London bawler’s <em>He Won’t Go</em>, it doesn’t at all feel like he’s doing it purely for the sake of it, and instead they’re perfectly suited to the magical feel of <em>Won’t Go</em>. Transforming the track into a seductive R’n’B inspired number, <strong>Dante Kinnunen’s </strong>vocals provide a fitting contrast to the pitch-shifted vocals of <strong>Adele</strong>, backed by heavy, brooding synths and a minimal, dubbed beat. Check out<em> Won’t Go</em> below.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29703591\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29703591\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dantekinnunen/dante-wont-go\">Dante – Won´t Go</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dantekinnunen\">DanteKinnunen</a></span> </p>\n","slug":"12988-new-dante-wont-go","category":"music","date":1323102763000,"wpid":12988,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293328558,"updatedAt":1588441785400,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/e8e0d5c658a65abb9324429026a7a15bfd575eff.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
