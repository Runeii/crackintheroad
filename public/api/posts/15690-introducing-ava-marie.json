Check out <strong>Ava Marie’s</strong> debut release below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 355px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3550260320/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"355\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15690-introducing-ava-marie","category":"introducing","date":1332174072000,"wpid":15690,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292651496,"updatedAt":1588441779962,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27382fe21a052b6097751b7a678.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
