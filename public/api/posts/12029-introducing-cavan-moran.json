The songwriting similarities are rather eerie at times, most prominently found within the vocal delivery and the eloquent lyricism. That said, with <strong>Conor Oberst</strong> being one of my favourite musicians of all time, I’m a sucker for charming poetry and Americana inspired vocals. <em>Until The End</em>, the opening track of his debut EP is a fine example of insightful, heart-warming songwriting. A love song that finds <strong>Moran</strong> in his absolute element, gushing <em>‘i’ve told you before and I’ll tell you again, from the top of my lungs to the tip of my pen’</em>, a line that <strong>Oberst</strong> himself would be proud of.</p>\n<p>In an age of counterfeit songwriters (here’s looking at you <strong>Ed Sheeran</strong>), it’s rewarding and refreshing to hear such genuine, intelligent compositions. Acoustic driven music can often fall rather flat, but in the case of <strong>Cavan Moran</strong> he finds the balance between expressing personality and maintaining an admirable sense of realism. Check out <em>Until The End</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2145012513/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12029-introducing-cavan-moran","category":"introducing","date":1319481620000,"wpid":12029,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293638871,"updatedAt":1587825912888,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
