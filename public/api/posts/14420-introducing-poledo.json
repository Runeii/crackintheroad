On his <strong><em>Jesus Christ </em></strong>demo (self-confessedly recorded with the guitar and Macbook that his parents bought him), Clements frequents those same fuzzy, indistinct avenues that Lou Barlow explored in his <em>Poledo</em>, with some of the overdriven mayhem that constituted the record preceding it. Where <em>Death Of A Friend </em>and <em>I Want To Be A Metalhead </em>exhibit all the exuberance and distorted squeal you’d expect from an adolescent Dino fan, it’s on final track <em>All You Do </em>that Clements starts to really show his potential, channeling Broken Social Scene into Garageband, and adding fidgety beats and brass stabs to his sonic melange. There’s talk of a ‘proper’ EP in the next few months, and outside the confines of his bedroom, who knows what Clements might be capable of?</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4116366362/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>You can listen to the <strong><em>Jesus Christ </em></strong>EP <a href=\"https://poledo.bandcamp.com/\">here</a>, and/or follow Evan on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/evansuckss\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n","slug":"14420-introducing-poledo","category":"introducing","date":1327611552000,"wpid":14420,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292995967,"updatedAt":1588441783124,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2012/01/poledo-165x109.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
