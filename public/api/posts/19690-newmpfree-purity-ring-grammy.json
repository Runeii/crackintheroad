There’s no doubt of what the group are capable of, as singles like ‘Ungirthed’ or ‘Lofticries’ showcased, but, on the album, there was always the sense that they could have done more.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting elements of Purity Ring since the release of <em>Shrines</em> has been how they’ve been adopted by the industry as a whole, with Danny Brown’s rapping over Belispeak a particular highlight. The group have continued this vaguely left-field trend by releasing a cover of the Soulja Boy song ‘Grammy’, which, as the event itself has just occurred  is probably the closest thing the band have gotten to social commentary.</p>\n<p>If you’re aware of what Purity Ring sound like, you’re not going to be surprised by the direction the cover takes, but, damn, do Megan James and Corin Roddick make it sound good. ‘Grammy’ can be downloaded <a href=\"https://purityringsongs.com/grammy.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> or you can watch the video above.</p>\n","slug":"19690-newmpfree-purity-ring-grammy","category":"mpfree","date":1360610568000,"wpid":19690,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":110,"src":"2013/02/purity-ring-165x110.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIBAAAgEEAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABESIQUTBBRhIv/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME/8QAGxEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxETQfD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMp5/lJvd8dNpBJnOpjNizAtjf5+jr5Uufm375OmR5Ysjg7IAWF9Ei+iaUqelRqX3TDoUFckT//Z"},"createdAt":1587283992545,"updatedAt":1588443770044,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"2013/02/purity-ring-165x110.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
