However in mid April <strong>Alex Mattinson</strong> (formerly of <strong>These Single Spies</strong> and now lead guitarist with <strong>Emmy The Great</strong>) got in touch to thank CitR for posting about <strong>Death to Dreaming</strong>, his new musical project, and to inform us of us intention to put out more new tracks in June. True to his word, here they are, in the form of the lo-fi pop inspired <em>Screen Tests</em> and <em>Monster Mask</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3132732809/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe><br />\n<iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1692282415/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe><br />\n<iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2853649056/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Drawing from the likes of <strong>Boards of Canada</strong> and <strong>The Magnetic Fields</strong>, there’s a gloriously unique songwriting quality to both songs, that simultaneously feel emotionally unstable yet confidently self-assured.
