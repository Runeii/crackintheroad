It seems things didn’t go completely to plan, the band reportedly took to the stage sometime after 1:00 a.m. but after only 20 minutes of their set they were told to stop. A crowd had formed outside and it was starting to get ugly as people jostled to get a better look at the band.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the set Sebastian talked to the press.<em>“I didn’t know the police were beating people,”</em> singer/drummer Sebastien Grainger told Spinner shortly after the set. <em>“Damn, now I feel bad.”</em> Pretty exciting stuff, and with no reported lasting injuries I’m pretty sure it’s ok to say it was an entirely appropriate return for the band. It’s good to have you back.</p>\n<p><em>Check out videos taken from SXSW bellow.</em></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnxNYRUIQr8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6AP1c8vqm0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"5612-news-death-from-above-1979-fuck-shit-up","category":"music","date":1300719230000,"wpid":5612,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/03/death_from_above_1979-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMG/8QAHhAAAgICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIABAMFERIGIUH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AwHhCIu4XhVHLOPQ+dHkt5UrJutgqV8KqLGQABAAB2MRA/9k="},"createdAt":1587294622551,"updatedAt":1588443779325,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/03/death_from_above_1979-292x50.jpg","categories":["music"]}
