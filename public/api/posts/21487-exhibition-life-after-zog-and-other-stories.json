As a child, she would imagine the stories of the families and country the people had left behind, as they sought refuge from the collapse of communism in the 90’s.</p>\n<p>She took her first trip in 2009, but then made many returns as she discovered that what the Western media portrayed was completely different to what she saw. She tells her story ‘<i>after long walks on mountainous footpaths, shared bus rides over steep ravines and sailing adventures across magical lakes in high Albania.’ </i>Nice.</p>\n<p>The exhibition held a selection of images, along with a beautifully designed publication, so good I had to run over the road to the cashy hole to purchase this beauty. I rarely buy books from exhibitions, ‘coz y’know, you have your experience and the help of the web for reference, but, geeky as it sounds, I fell in love with the symmetry of the squared images, that when in the context of a book created a new way of seeing them; you had the stori<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #444444; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">es in your hands, these people were yours to keep.</span></span></p>\n<p>I felt abit gooey and contemplative as I walked down the poorly carpeted steps in my exit, as you might have guessed. The photographs initially seduced me with their diligently considered colour pallets and compositions; leading the viewer into a closer consideration to what is being portrayed. The exhibition held a perfect balance of candid portraits of the Albanian people, and the more intimate domestic spaces that connote the modern parallels between rural and city life.</p>\n<p>I too am now wondering about these people that had to flee to find peace within the politics, in the undeniable ignorance of the Western life i lead. Tocci’s personal expedition with political undercurrents harmonize to confirm what I most value in any artistic pursuit: to step outside of your own world, to relive and revive your imagination, to then create an impression of your experience of a place and its people.</p>\n<p>The exhibition runs from the 28<sup>th</sup> of April at the Thrid Floor Gallery in Cardiff Bay.</p>\n<p>For more info
