Layered with climatic instrumentation, <strong>Young Eyes </strong>sound is both beautiful and engaging as each track encourages you to explore the dark recesses and bright horizons which will no doubt be stirred in your imagination.</p>\n<p>With the first track entitled by the date it was released (ignore the erroneous bandcamp release date), hopefully the date within the title of the second track will prove to be just as successful.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=160215722/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10953-introducing-young-eyes","category":"introducing","date":1315296011000,"wpid":10953,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/young-eyes-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQMI/8QAJBAAAQIFAwUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAgESAAMFESEEBjEHExYjUjL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABoRAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDAAIREkH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AE90dSKNXdibipdO107UqOk7ilLElElOYqM/OM25+ozKbhMkYqWW0IUkB8eqExqPScAutmzVxeKDKltT1hx8pEKUFggHMb335P/Z"},"createdAt":1587293920567,"updatedAt":1588403548890,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2011/09/young-eyes-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","music","reviews"]}
