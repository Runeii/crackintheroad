Never before had I delved into that submerged level of emotional complexity, not just expressed through <strong>Curtis’s</strong> renowned vocals, but also found amongst the dense layering and mood shattering atmosphere. Suffice to say, <strong><em>From Under The Cork Tree</em></strong> has not been a regular player since.</p>\n<p>Whilst Manchester noise-pop duo <strong>Noise Exposure</strong> are still finding their feet, their self-titled debut EP clearly owes much to Curtis & Co. Building a sultry mood through the brooding synths and steady percussion section, combined with the jagged guitar line to forge a rather all enveloping curtain of sound. More modern comparisons could be made to <strong>The Horrors</strong> second album and their slick, refined appearance is vaguely <strong>The Kills</strong>-esque.</p>\n<p>The EP is daunting and quietly confident of itself, despite the tracks tellingly similar nature, showing that <strong>Noise Exposure</strong> aren’t too keen to experiment this early in their career. <em>Your Boat Is Sinking</em> and <em>One Last Hit</em> are the EP’s standout moments, both more psychedelic and luxuriously hazy than their predecessors. Whilst there’s an underlying feeling that <strong>Noise Exposure</strong> are yet to truly discover their full potential, I have no doubts that once they will, they’ll be catapulted to a much larger audience.</p>\n<p>Check out the self-titled EP below and grab a free download.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"150\" height=\"450\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1009931959/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://noiseexposure.bandcamp.com/album/noise-exposure-ep\">Noise Exposure EP by Noise Exposure</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16036-review-noise-exposure-noise-exposure-ep","category":"mpfree","date":1334345007000,"wpid":16036,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292561223,"updatedAt":1587825898219,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
