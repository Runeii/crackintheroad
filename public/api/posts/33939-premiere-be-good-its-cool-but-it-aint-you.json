Recorded in the confines of the bedroom of singer Ash Cooke, there’s an almost 80’s soul vibe to it, whilst managing to feel entirely natural and fresh. With Cooke having initially met drummer Charles Clark at a ceramics evening class, before enlisting James Cunning and Patrick Burley on synth and bass respectively, there’s an honesty and emotion to their unique brand of odd pop, quite unlike anything else around right now.</p>\n<p>Documenting the beginnings of a new relationship, and “an intensity of feelings which I hadn’t really felt before”, It’s Cool but it Ain’t You is a mightily exciting step forward for the band.</p>\n<p>BE GOOD support The Big Moon on 18 October at The Bullingdon, Oxford.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://play.soundsgood.co/embed/59c2224a28509b652bb44d2f?hideCurator=1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33939-premiere-be-good-its-cool-but-it-aint-you","category":"music","date":1505904176000,"wpid":33939,"isSticky":true,"featured_image":{"width":3089,"height":2048,"src":"2017/09/be-good-promo-2-large.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAeEAACAgIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMFBBEAEiEGMf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/8QAGhEAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxEx4f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Aha/W29Jb21deSWfXCiVhEc9pHlDMiK7HfUesSQOWxcsS4sMmRU56zOgZxFInQMR713NvW/zfHHLYihQc75C2MSRvJ//Z"},"createdAt":1587279808539,"updatedAt":1588403498681,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/09/be-good-promo-2-large.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
