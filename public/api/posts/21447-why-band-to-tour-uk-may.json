WHY? enlisted the help of a professor at the University of North Texas music school for Mumps etc. He helped the band include performances from a string quartet and an eight-person choir alongside copious amounts of woodwind and horns.</p>\n<p>Flitting from egotistical wallowing to intense self deprication, Mumps etc cuts close to the swollen heart of our sick human condition. Or maybe that’s just me wanting to try and explain the album’s title.</p>\n","slug":"21447-why-band-to-tour-uk-may","category":"events","date":1366805769000,"wpid":21447,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283576317,"updatedAt":1588441766882,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d40","old_image":"2013/04/whysextet_4342_high-165x110.jpg","categories":["events","news","live-reviews","music"]}
