So it’s safe to say that Luxembourg’s <strong>We Are Intemporal</strong> don’t better the original, but hey, that’s impossible, but they certainly give it a good stab.</p><p> Their cover of <strong>Chris Isaak’s</strong> <em>Wicked Game</em> brings the 1989 classic into a far more modern light, sort of how I’d imagine it sounding if James Blake was to give it a go. Maintaining the perfect pop vibes that’s given it such longevity, We Are Intemporal stamp their own, rather minimal-inspired authority upon it.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1743889129/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23608-new-we-are-intemporal-wicked-game-chris-isaak-cover","category":"mpfree","date":1375452500000,"wpid":23608,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":600,"src":"2013/08/a2105010346_10.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQI/8QAHRAAAQQCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwABBBECIRITQf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDMkUEYkGaU0hxyBNg4R8b7Len35TbUaImD/9k="},"createdAt":1587283177295,"updatedAt":1588403528401,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/a2105010346_10.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
