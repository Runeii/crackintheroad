Therefore, we were delighted to be able to chat to George Lewis Jr, a.k.a. Twin Shadow, about European politeness, Coachella, and bad musicians.</p>\n<p><em>CitR: You’ve just started quite an extensive tour. How’s it been so far, and have you noticed any differences between American and European crowds?</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: Good. It’s been great. Europeans tend to be a bit more polite, I suppose, as an audience. Which is not better or worse. It’s kind of just a different thing, to just get used to that politeness – sometimes it’s a good thing, sometimes it’s a weird thing. </strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR: Your first album was critically well-acclaimed. How does that feel?</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: It feels great. Really happy, yeah.</strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR: What were your musical influences behind that album?</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: I didn’t really think about it too much. I think everything I’ve ever listened to in my life is an influence on this music. </strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR: You’ve been making music all your life. What made you sit down and decide to make this album?</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: I’ve been recording music forever. This project in particular was no different in the sense that I was always recording, but it was in the sense that I was using programming for the first time. I hadn’t been in a band for a while and I just wanted to create something that was my own thing.</strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR:  Twin Shadow. Where does that come from?</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: I have a twin sister, and those two words just popped up a lot in the last few years. No deep deep meaning.</strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR: Any plans after this tour?</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: Just more touring. We’re just gonna tour like crazy.</strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR: You’re playing Coachella. Excited?</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: Very excited. Very. You should go. </strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR: Well, I would.</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: It’s sold out now, isn’t it?</strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR: Yeah, and it’s not exactly cheap.</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: No, I guess not.</strong></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>CitR: Got any tips for up and coming artists?</em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twin Shadow: If you don’t think you’re good at it, find something else to do. The world doesn’t need anymore musicians. So if you’re really good at it, then hang in. If you have the slightest thing going that you’re not, find something that you like to do. Don’t just do it because there’s nothing else to do. </strong></p>\n","slug":"4183-interview-twin-shadow","category":"interviews","date":1296296137000,"wpid":4183,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":936,"height":720,"src":"2011/06/twin-shadow-burnin-up.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAgEAACAQMFAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgQABREDEhMiYSEx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQb/xAAbEQACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBAURIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AoO8aKttkSbfpKe+zS5scqldgL5BA7YwMe/po8iOXYtagjE/VUEgeClKnpMhKkmtdFVa0H//Z"},"createdAt":1587294798590,"updatedAt":1588403561260,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d16","old_image":"2011/06/twin-shadow-burnin-up.jpg","categories":["interviews","music"]}
