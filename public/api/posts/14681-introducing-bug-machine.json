With touches of a more upbeat, less stadium friendly <strong>M83</strong>, and even slight whiffs of Aphex Twin, the relentless <em>Heart Is On The Floor</em> yearns to be played to packed, sweaty indie club. Elsewhere there’s the repetitive swing of <em>Sympathy</em> and the infectious sample led bliss of <em>Slugs</em>, all complimented by<strong> Bug Machine’s</strong> soft, reassuring vocals.</p>\n<p>Check out<em> Slugs</em> and <em>Sympathy</em> below, and head over to his <a href=\"https://bugmachine.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> for a full download.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1277493444/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://bugmachine.bandcamp.com/track/sympathy\">Sympathy by bug machine</a></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=232409178/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://bugmachine.bandcamp.com/track/slugs\">Slugs by bug machine</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14681-introducing-bug-machine","category":"introducing","date":1328645091000,"wpid":14681,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292922874,"updatedAt":1587825903625,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
