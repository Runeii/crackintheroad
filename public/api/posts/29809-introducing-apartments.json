{"id":"5e9bffed774c2610387e45aa","artists":["5e9b68cd7a1236eccfeb1dc4"],"title":"Introducing: Apartments","content":"<p>In the same way that The Yum Dee Days appeared out of nowhere in releasing one of my favourite records of 2013, Sydney’s <strong>Apartments</strong> (Charles Wu) has done much the same, with<strong><em> La Salle</em></strong>.</p><p> For all that it’s recorded and mixed in one bedroom at Wu’s home, there’s a continual underlying feeling throughout that he’s a bit of a genius. Like the recently Domino signed Alex G, I can’t help but think that were this tied up to an uber-cool indie, you’d have people going crazy over it. It’s at times ramshackle, confusing and not entirely coherent, yet it’s so undeniably endearing, from the Scott Walker indebted balladry of<em> Last Station Blues</em> to the acoustic beauty of <em>I Saw My Father On The Street, </em>with the exquisitely intriguing songwriting always remaining at the core.</p>\n<p>Mixing in seemingly random found sounds, snippets of answer phone messages and even elements of 70’s Bowie inspired psychedelic pop, there’s just so much going on here, and sadly, an album that will probably go unappreciated. Much like the recently re-emerged <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19389-lewis-lamour/\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis</a>, Apartments feels like he belongs to another time, and leaving the programmed drum samples sounding deceivingly modern.
