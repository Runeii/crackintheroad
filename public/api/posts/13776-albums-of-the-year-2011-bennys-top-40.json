UK hip-hop (non-grime) has often been a bit cringey – either too preachy and serious or too silly and English. <strong>Jehst</strong> can dispell that myth in one verse by doing both – a healthy balance of humour and truth.

South American Cumbia music reinterpreted by a young Argentinian electronic producer, if you want to see it on paper.

It has a loose, mixtape vibe, and is essentially just beats. But these are personal. They’re not <strong>FlyLo</strong>‘s or <strong>Dilla</strong>‘s, they’re <em>his</em>. He has a distinctively playful, childish style that cannot be recreated by anyone else, and this album is great fun.

I’ve been finding that more and more this year, which can only be a good thing.

The group have been active across North Africa, and this has been their most interesting (TVOTR, New Orleans’ The Dirty Dozen Brass Band) and consistent album.<br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/16-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nonagonic Now\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13984\" />\n<p>#25 <strong>Orchestra Of Spheres</strong> – <strong><em>Nonagonic Now</em></strong> [Fire]</p>\n<p>New Zealand freaks making the most abstract, experimental music I’ve heard in a while. Jazz, afro-beat, funk, psych-rock, it’s all there, somewhere. It’s not tied down to anything, and it’s great like that.

This can’t be called chillwave, how is one supposed to chill to it? It’s a 1980’s retrogasm, and it’s an intense ride. This is more Vangelis than Neon Indian – sheer nostalgic pulp.

Luckily there are still some of us who were tickled by the surprise album, and subsequently gifted with reinterpretations from the cream of the crop.

Influenced by many of my favourite bands  and coming up with some of the greatest lyrics known to man, I can feel this band becoming one of my long-time favourites.<br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/20-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"We're New Here\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13988\" />\n<p>#21 <strong>Gil Scott-Heron & Jamie xx</strong> – <strong><em>We’re New Here</em></strong> [Young Turks/XL]</p>\n<p>I was surprised to find many fans of this album hadn’t actually heard 2010’s <em>I’m New Here</em> before hearing this, and I think it’s important to listen to both. Smith took a brave leap putting so much effort into this, transforming Scott-Heron’s poetry into a Burroughs-esque sonic mess of electronica and pattern. The album is a metaphysical branch between generations, and a great testiment to Gil.<br />\n <br />\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/21-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Black Up\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13989\" />#20 <strong>Shabazz Palaces</strong> – <strong><em>Black Up</em></strong> [Sub Pop]</p>\n<p>Like our generation’s <strong>Sun Ra</strong>, except less jazzing about and more rhymes. Spacious, far reaching and non-apologetic, the album <em>feels</em> unnatural and natural simultaneously. Raps weirdos all just sat up at once, and slumped back down once they heard this.<br />\n <br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/22-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Cults\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13990\" />\n<p>#19 <strong>Cults</strong> – <strong><em>Cults</em></strong> [Columbia]</p>\n<p>A naïve but enthralling sound, this debut bowled me over when I heard what the fuss was about. Some have detracted from their original enthusiasm, but here I see a few kids making excellent pop songs that really deliver, and it’s irresistible stuff despite being purely impulsive. High hopes they aren’t chewed up in the major label machine and can deliver again.<br />\n <br />\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/23-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Katang\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13991\" />#18 <strong>Zun Zun Egui</strong> – <strong><em>Katang</em></strong> [Bella Union]</p>\n<p>Hailing from Bristol, Planet Earth, this band are just plain retarded. The most tidy comparison I’ve heard is to <strong>Talking Heads</strong>, but when I listen to them I think more <strong>Boredoms</strong>-style noise-rock. The singer doesn’t so much sing as yelp in a blend of different languages. A big tropical heart attack waiting to happen, yet so much <em>fun</em> being created.<br />\n <br />\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/realestate-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"realestate\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14214\" />#17 <strong>Real Estate</strong> – <strong><em>Days</em></strong> [Domino]</p>\n<p>A huge improvement on the last one, so laid back and jangly (the good kind). I’ve visited New Jersey once before, and this is really how it feels in the suburbs. I don’t think Real Estate could ever be embarrassed by the music they make, and this is the best example they could ever give for why they’re a brilliant band.<br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/25-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Exmilitary\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13993\" />\n<p>#16 <strong>Death Grips</strong> – <strong><em>Exmilitary</em></strong> [Third Worlds]</p>\n<p><strong>Zack Hill</strong>‘s latest project is deep, excessive and brooding. There’s some joking around in there somewhere (<strong>Beastie Boys</strong> samples) but really this is a serious, agressive beast. A force to be reckoned with. <strong>Death Grips</strong> are doing everything on their terms, not anyone elses.

Where his contemporaries (<strong>FaltyDL</strong>, <strong>Cosmin TRG</strong>) almost got to this year, Martijn Deykers excelled.<br />\n <br />\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/27-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"So Beautiful Or So What\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13995\" />#14 <strong>Paul Simon</strong> – <strong><em>So Beautiful Or So What</em></strong> [Hear]</p>\n<p>Literally, there is no failing this man. Just as you thought he might try and repeat old successes, he shows a new generation how to do it <em>properly</em> – to get an idea, in 2011 he was 70 just the day before I was 21. Why should I, or anyone else, bother trying to write music at this age? The short answer is not to bother; <strong>Paul Simon</strong> already wrote all the best music.<br />\n <br />\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/28-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Rolling Blackouts\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13996\" />#13 <strong>The Go!

This Brighton band are a staple band in the UK, and we don’t even realise it – here I continue my crusade of praising this undervalued band. Where else can you hear <strong>Sonic Youth</strong>-guitars, 80’s hip-hop, playground chants and cult film samples all together?

What Albarn & Co achieved is more than the sum of its parts – it’s an example of a cultural symbiosis of two very different groups of people feeding off one another, and from this end it sounds brilliantly different every time I hear it.<br />\n <br />\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/30-165x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Forever Dolphin Love\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13998\" />#11 <strong>Connan Mockasin</strong> – <strong><em>Forever Dolphin Love</em></strong> [Because/Phantasy]</p>\n<p>This album was originally released as 2010’s <em>Please Turn Me Into The Snat</em>, but I didn’t hear it until early 2011. I can understand why <strong>Erol Alkan</strong> re-released the album – a) because it’s a simple yet intense listen, and b) because Connan is a cult hero in waiting. An otherworldly dreamworld is where Connan lives; we can only wonder what he’s going on about, but in the meantime, just soak it up.

By 2011 <strong>Machinedrum</strong> was about as relevant as oxygen in the world. Who knew there’d be plenty of soul to an album entirely composed of garage, Chicago juke and house? <strong>Sepalcure</strong>‘s debut was nearly as good as this, but <strong>Machinedrum</strong> doing his solo thing has much more of an atmosphere to it.<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/321-260x260.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"32\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14179\" />\n<p>#9 <strong>Ty Segall</strong> – <strong><em>Goodbye Bread</em></strong> [Drag City]</p>\n<p>To me, this guy is as relevant as <strong>Jay Reatard</strong> ever was. He employs a stripped-back approach to stoner garage rock to wonderful effect, and Goodbye Bread just sounds so easy for this man, yet at the same time seems his most focused effort. <strong>Lou Reed</strong>, <strong>Iggy Pop</strong> and <strong>Marc Bolan</strong> would be equally as impressed by this guy.

Whilst <strong>Fucked Up</strong> continue screaming all over their tracks,<strong> Pneu</strong> just concentrate entirely on the sound of the instruments, and the intensity they can produce with them. They sound like they’re having the most fun ever with this stuff.

A surprisingly mature debut with a strange industrial sound reminiscent of <strong>Matthew Dear</strong>, <strong>Trent Reznor</strong> and <strong>David Bowie</strong> in places, and not really what you might expect from a member of one of the best contemporary guitar bands.<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/351-260x260.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"35\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14191\" />\n<p>#6 <strong>Atlas Sound</strong> – <em><strong>Parallax</strong></em> [4AD]</p>\n<p>With <em>Parralax</em>, Bradford Cox abandoned the lo-fi sentiment of his previous records, and his band <strong>Deerhunter</strong>, and it proved a worthy choice. This is clearly an intimate, personal piece of work, and it unravels beautifully. There’s not much I can say about this album in all honesty – you should already have heard it before it was on this list really!<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/361-260x260.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"36\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14192\" />\n<p>#5 <strong>Battles</strong> – <strong><em>Gloss Drop</em></strong> [Warp]</p>\n<p>Despite the obvious departure of frontman <strong>Tyondai Braxton</strong>, the now-trio succeeded two critically successful EP’s and one hugely praised debut album with this: some people turned their heads, but those who didn’t got to see some of the boldest vocal spots (<strong>Gary</strong>-fucking-<strong>Newman</strong> everybody) in place of <strong>Braxton</strong>‘s vocoded ramblings, but in majority solely instrumental explorations as a continuation of the original EP’s. As an album, <em>Gloss Drop</em> works wonders, and was the next logical step for the band. They can only go up from here.<br />\n <br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/371-260x260.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"37\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14193\" />\n<p>#4 <strong>Young Montana?</strong> – <em><strong>Limerence</strong></em> [Alpha Pup]</p>\n<p>Few could predict a young man from Coventry to show up anything coming out of America’s beat scenes, but he did. <em>Limerence</em> was a showcase of youthful prestige and sheer inventiveness – allegedly <strong>Chemise</strong>, the artist who wrote the ’87 original (<em>She Can’t Love You</em>) sampled in the track <em>Sacré Cool</em>, said Pritchard’s re-imagining was “second only to the original”. Now if that’s not a blessing I don’t know what is.<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/381-260x260.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"38\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14194\" />\n<p>#3 <strong>Panda Bear </strong>– <em><strong>Tomboy</strong></em> [Paw Tracks]</p>\n<p>Being a huge <strong>Animal Collective</strong> fan is occasionally taxing – I can’t seem to break into their experimental stuff, and had gripes with Noah Lennox’s <em>Person Pitch</em>. <em>Tomboy</em> rectified that problem. Any track sums up the expressive, bewildering but not quite pretentious angst absorbed within the sound of this album. Some other words? Spacious, captivating, and ironically, warm. I love this album. It haunts me and it will haunt you too. In a good way, mind.<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/392-260x260.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"39\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14195\" />\n<p>#2 <strong>Rustie</strong> – <em><strong>Glass Swords</strong></em> [Warp]</p>\n<p>A real Marmite album in the electronic music world was a true winner for me. It has some kind of inexplicable aura about it, one that is difficult to analyse: sure, Simon Reynolds <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8721-maximal-nation/\">tried</a>, but there’s <em>something else</em> present. Sure it’s garish, neon and nothing less than completely over-the-top, but those are all criticisms of the elements; despite being quite an indulgent effort, this album is much more than the sum of its parts. It taps into the 90’s generation (a hangover of the 80’s), as well as taking everything deemed ‘commercial’ in contemporary pop music and rubbing it up the right way.<br />\n </p>\n<img src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2012/01/401-260x260.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"40\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14197\" />\n<p>#1 <strong>Fair Ohs</strong> – <em><strong>Everything Is Dancing</strong></em> [Honey High]</p>\n<p>A record full of all sorts of honest optimism, and throaty yowling, I didn’t plan on it filling my dead soul with enthusiasm. This band did just that, and I don’t feel cheated in any way at all. Informed by equal parts afro-beat and garage rock, this isn’t a polished sound – ‘rough-hewn’ would be more appropriate in fact. Charisma is important with this kind of foreign-influenced guitar music, and <strong>Fair Ohs</strong> maintain plenty, without being dickheads about it. It’s an album to be respected, and it’s more fun than anything else on here. Off-kilter and exotic, but also very English. And my favourite album of 2011.</p>\n","slug":"13776-albums-of-the-year-2011-bennys-top-40","category":"editorials","date":1326830416000,"wpid":13776,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293062921,"updatedAt":1588441783609,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/2f5e42dfdf965ae8fc2715253ea1f99df9449c12.jpg","categories":["editorials","music"]}
