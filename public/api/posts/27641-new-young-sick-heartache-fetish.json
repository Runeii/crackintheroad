Previously described as ‘future soul’, it’s immersive and hard-hitting, whilst maintaining the pop sensibilities that will no doubt open his music up to a much wider audience. <em>Heartache Fetish</em> is featured on his debut album, out 8 April via Harvest Records.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141198682&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27641-new-young-sick-heartache-fetish","category":"music","date":1395843921000,"wpid":27641,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":851,"height":315,"src":"2014/03/1912282_596569307088627_60269740_n.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAECAIAAAA4WjmaAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAh0lEQVR4nAF8AIP/APUkNO4lNNonNOslNPokNNgkMdUnM9soNfQjM/ckNAD1IzPLKjW5KjTIJjHHJzK6LTe5LDaeLzW9LTfnIzIA1yk2wjA7zyo2ySs2tCw2vS85vS85ry02sTc/zC04AMwtOdYxPcIuOcErNtEqNsEwOsQpNNQtOc4vO9kpNrBqL16YkgsTAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"},"createdAt":1587282295043,"updatedAt":1588403517198,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/03/1912282_596569307088627_60269740_n.png","categories":["music","new"]}
