{"id":"5e9bf80d8fb2d30d7769c900","title":"New: Bruno Major – Second Time","content":"<p>Bruno Major’s new track <em>Second Time </em>is a gorgeous ballad that needs to be heard.</p><p> Originally written by fellow songwriter Jonny Latimer, Bruno released it after getting Jonny’s blessing and has done it all the justice it deserves. A beautiful and simple story of infatuation, the lyrics set the scene supported by a sweet melody. The song feels almost like a lullaby with Bruno’s gentle vocals and fingered picked acoustic, however the addition of tight drums and a woozy guitar solo towards the end of the track keep it from being too sleepy.
