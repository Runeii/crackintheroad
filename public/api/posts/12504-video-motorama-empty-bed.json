Showing the group at a beach, playing a rather twisted game of Russian Roulette, the visuals perfectly fit the dark, sinister feel of the track. It’s beautifully shot, with the subdued colours adding another element of mystique to the clip, with numerous close-up shots of faces and body parts. Fear of the unknown is one thing; fear of the known but unsure is another entirely.
