The opening track to be taken from it, <em>Sunder,</em> is a lush, sprawling surf pop jam, channeling Wild Nothing and The Drums, alongside touches of The Cure. With songwriting this good and a cunning ear for a swelteringly addictive hook, Hibou is sure to have labels falling over themselves. <em>Sunder</em> is available as a free download from Hibou’s <a href=\"https://hiboumichel.bandcamp.com/track/sunder\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp</a> page, with the rest of EP released on 13 June.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F93244273\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22243-premiere-hibou-sunder","category":"mpfree","date":1370001493000,"wpid":22243,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283440499,"updatedAt":1588441766041,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/18522814d330e6ddf2002e52796c67b3affa0207.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
