A quick glance at his soundcloud shows he’s only following three artists, Radiohead, Holy Other and Balam Acab, yet the influence can be heard on Creation. A swirling, majestic track, it focuses on building an ethereal atmosphere, through shoegaze-esque synths and almost water-like samples. It’s a rush that’s for sure. Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F35699500&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14867-new-lerk-creation","category":"introducing","date":1328889798000,"wpid":14867,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2012/02/avatars-000009889814-6ays4y-crop-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQQG/8QAJxAAAQMCBQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAURAAYSFDETIRUkMkFDUYH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AOqtfrnhrNRS/tBPFulGOhOkDTew4JtckWwe1meUhpCXIqCsABR7c/qcXZ0SkZnozQADQjsWQB2HHtjfy4UXdveWY9avjH3gP/9k="},"createdAt":1587292873304,"updatedAt":1588443775835,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/02/avatars-000009889814-6ays4y-crop-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
