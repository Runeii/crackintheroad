{"id":"5e9c323d9b6559241525de85","artists":["5e9b694b7a1236eccfeb25d1"],"title":"New: Teen Daze – Together/Something","content":"<p>Chillwave, glo-fi, dream pop; whatever the hell you want to call it, it’s far too shallow and presumptuous to categorize so many artists into such a cramped and inadequate definition.</p><p> Today saw the premiere of material through the exciting new label that is Cultus Vibes, with a digital single from Teen Daze being their debut release. A-Side Together is a blissed out affair, sampling Bonfire by Ontario based Memoryhouse. A repetitive yet controlling beat elegantly guides the track on it’s way, whilst shoegaze influences are eerily prominent but not all-consuming.</p>\n<p>The B-side Something is a more upbeat, dance inspired number, expertly sampling Hewlett Place by Aidan Knight. There’s undoubtedly touches of Baths and Nosaj Thing caught up in the webs of intricacy that fashion this track. However you want to label Teen Daze, the music is inspired and engrossing to devour, and what’s more it’s available as a free download from the link below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cultusvibes.bandcamp.com/album/digital-7-no-2-together-b-w-something\">Download Together/Something</a></p>\n","slug":"4281-new-teen-daze-togethersomething","category":"music","date":1296597190000,"wpid":4281,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294781076,"updatedAt":1587825930681,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","remixes","reviews"]}
