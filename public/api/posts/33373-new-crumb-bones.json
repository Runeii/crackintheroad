Opening with a smooth, winding intro that swings in tone between indie and jazz, every instrument shines. Once the vocals come in the song transitions to a soulful pop song with Lila Ramani’s voice somewhat hidden in the mix and complemented by lead guitar and synth riffs. The track constantly keeps you guessing. There is a phenomenal guitar led instrumental interlude between the two vocal sections and then the track is whisked away by a psychedelic passage leading into a fiery jazz sax solo that closes the song. The band fits in an astonishing amount in for what feels like such a short song and really leaves you craving more. Catch the video for the Bones below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nD3iG6m44g8?start=3&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33373-new-crumb-bones","category":"music","date":1488470251000,"wpid":33373,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1200,"height":1197,"src":"2017/03/0008197956_10.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQFBv/EACMQAAEDAwIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxEABCESEwUGQVFxobH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABkRAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAQISIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A0CLx5xhtTEXVqpGtt9BMEE5gCIz980UcRc0iFYjo6aV5VUW7QbZKY3UjSYgbhx7NWbh50XDoDiwAogAKPem11KLyp4f/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587279906964,"updatedAt":1588403502209,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"2017/03/0008197956_10.jpg","categories":["music"]}
