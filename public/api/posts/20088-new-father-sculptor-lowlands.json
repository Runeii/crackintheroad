Aggressive, raw and emotional, there’s desolation, self-pity and sexuality expressed through their music, both epic and intimate at the same time. With a UK tour on it’s way, <strong>Father Sculptor</strong> have an extremely bright future ahead of themselves.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F80051733\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20088-new-father-sculptor-lowlands","category":"music","date":1361801192000,"wpid":20088,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283886295,"updatedAt":1588441769637,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27311f37df0419c89a6a0566d86.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
