{"id":"5e9bf7c28fb2d30d7769c7dd","title":"New: Child Ivory – Rhetoric / Angie","content":"<p>Two blissful new tracks from Utah’s <strong>Child Ivory</strong>, one of my favourite new discoveries of the year.</p><p> Rhetoric especially is refreshingly honest as a track, seamlessly merging some classically influenced songwriting with a very 80’s-esque production style, it still manages to come across as truly authentic and natural. Accompanied by a brilliant video shot in Taiwan with local actors, there’s elements of everyone from Phil Collins to M83 to Rhetoric. Check it out below alongside their other recent single, Angie.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/feIysCD6j4Q\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/339054422&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33926-new-child-ivory-rhetoric-angie","category":"music","date":1505322943000,"wpid":33926,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2560,"height":1126,"src":"2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-13-at-19.13.59.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAECAIAAAA4WjmaAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAhElEQVR4nGNQUjWWVzG0dfQyM7PSN7LR0rXWNzC1sTKIS82vyC1gCI8tiEnISUnPj4rNTEvLTkrISkzMSknOXLh0TXVxOUNeUX1oZLKvf2RGcmZcbHJYcJSnm194ZEpDS2d1bR2DhbWbho6VsaljcUaEv6ebkaGts42dhblDaHRacW0jAGZeKEvxpWxRAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"},"createdAt":1587279810727,"updatedAt":1588403498763,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-13-at-19.13.59.png","categories":["music","new"]}
