Of the three tracks available so far, <em>The Hunt</em> is the pick of the bunch; dark, otherworldly and utterly brilliant. There’s touches of <strong>Purity Ring</strong>, <strong>Björk</strong> and, most obviously, <strong>Grimes</strong>, but even Boucher’s unique, exuberant style comes nowhere near to <strong>Tigerwing</strong> in terms of levels of sheer mindfuck.</p>\n<p>On other tracks, there’s the shrill cry of <em>Ophelia</em>, fusing eccentric pop inspirations, with a twisted, almost psychotic element, whereas <em>Weight of Want</em> dances wildly and completely out of control. In truth, I’m struggling to explain exactly how I feel about <strong>Tigerwing</strong>, so I’ll stick to this – she’s one of my favourite new artists of the year.</p>\n<p>Check out all three tracks below, and grab a download from her <a href=\"https://tigerwing.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F6412167%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-bj021\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22332-introducing-tigerwing","category":"introducing","date":1370437771000,"wpid":22332,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283425344,"updatedAt":1588441765853,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/e425a4c8d5bdaf265afcdc930ab4493c8d1193f8.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
