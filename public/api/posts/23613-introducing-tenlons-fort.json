His new self-titled record is one of this years understated beauties, compelling, emotionally touching songwriting at its utmost pure and desirable of repeated listens. With elements of folk-pop a la <strong>Fleetwood Mac</strong> or <strong>Damien Jurado</strong>, mixed alongside more upbeat influences (dare I say <strong>Vampire Weekend</strong>), it’s a truly gorgeous listen. Check out Tenlons Fort below, including my highlight <em>Disaster Speaks</em> and <em>Your Hand Is A Song</em>, which is scheduled to have an official release later in the year.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 758px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=145715859/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23613-introducing-tenlons-fort","category":"introducing","date":1375464299000,"wpid":23613,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":534,"src":"2013/08/maxresdefault-950x534.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQI/8QAIRAAAgICAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEBgUSEyExYXH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Az1qjWPGDLL0+F2195PJseaQSyIR7jq+0L6u6uyfoZfucbhj250RkVFdgFKlqAPxdi/3GMD//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283174027,"updatedAt":1588443768245,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/maxresdefault-950x534.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
