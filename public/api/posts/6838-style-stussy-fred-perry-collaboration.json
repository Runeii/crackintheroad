Keeping in theme with the 2 brands, the collections features the famous Fred Perry polo’s, but with the dates of the brand and the name of the brand stamped on the back like a football shirt. Complimentary colours are used; black and white for Stussy and red and white for Fred Perry. As well as this they have produced a set of crew and V-neck short sleeve t-shirt, which again mirror the colour and print designs of the polo shirts.  In the accessories department of the collaboration a holdall barrel bag, a belt and 2 pairs of shoes have been designed. The shoes are laced with mesh and ribbing to give it a summery feeling, also the Fred Perry shoe Byron has been given a more summery colour palette of white and red. The shoes will be sold exclusively in the <a href=\"https://www.fredperry.com/shops/\" target=\"_blank\">Laurel Wreath shops</a> till the 23<sup>rd</sup> of May. The rest of the collection will be sold on the Fred Perry/Stussy websites and stores.</p>\n","slug":"6838-style-stussy-fred-perry-collaboration","category":"life","date":1303231505000,"wpid":6838,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/04/hamish3-292x50.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAACCAYAAABhYU3QAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAXUlEQVR4nAFSAK3/AOnRwv/MJiH/51NM/9C1rv9uSTf/jHNg/+3r2//f2cD/v7qZ/5KJaP8A6N7K/+jMu//05OP/9fT5/6CZlP+wqqj/7u7v/9LOtP+xrIf/g3ta/33QPQh2YKNaAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"},"createdAt":1587294488654,"updatedAt":1588443778529,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d1e","old_image":"2011/04/hamish3-292x50.png","categories":["life"]}
