That said, who cares where a group come from when they make music as good as these two new tracks from the electro-wave duo. Heavily shoegaze influenced, <em>Blossom</em> is a sleazy <strong>My Bloody Valentine</strong>-esque number; relentless and unforgiving in sound, but utterly fantastic. On the flip-side <em>Cold Hearted</em> is another brooding, mysterious effort; walls of guitars block out any glimmer of optimistic light whilst the female vocals are elegant and vivaciously dominating. Check out <em>Blossom</em> and <em>Cold Hearted</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"410\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2544564844/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://phosphor.bandcamp.com/album/cold-hearted-ep\">Cold Hearted EP by PHOSPHOR</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12501-new-phosphor-blossom-cold-hearted","category":"mpfree","date":1321100243000,"wpid":12501,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293492344,"updatedAt":1588441786622,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/8dfe24344b0766d9fad238f10cedc7c82d4abfe4.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
