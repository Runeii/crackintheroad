There’s something in Rossen’s voice that’s so stripped-back and semi-worried, something like a melancholic <strong>Cat Stevens</strong>, or thereabouts if I had to make a comparison. He’s an essential element to <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong>‘s unique sound – <em>Yellow House</em> is one of my favourite albums of all time, and it wouldn’t have been without his voice and musicianship. If the rest of the material is like this, I know I’m thoroughly looking forward to it.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Saint Nothing below</em>. <em>Silent Hour / Golden Mile EP is out on March 19th on CD/12″/download via Warp Records</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wMG2jbvCr0Y\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></center></p>\n","slug":"14264-new-daniel-rossen-saint-nothing","category":"music","date":1326903722000,"wpid":14264,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293054043,"updatedAt":1588441783498,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/89c47ef9f2336a4dedd3823b5a696c6f94a3f208.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
