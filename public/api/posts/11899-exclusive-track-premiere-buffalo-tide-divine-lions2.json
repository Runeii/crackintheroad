With his forthcoming EP, entitled <em><strong>Arabia</strong></em> set for release next month, we’re delighted to be able to premiere the lead track from it, in the form of the radiantly engrossing <em>Divine Lions</em>. <strong>Buffalo Tide</strong> perfectly captures a rare storytelling ability that is seemingly lost in a vast proportion of electronic based music, a trait that is utilized with great purpose on <em>Divine Lions</em>. Flowing seamlessly between dubstep influenced breakdowns and more striking, upbeat sections, it’s a track that requires and deserves full mental immersion.</p>\n<p>Buffalo Tide’s new EP <em><strong>Arabia</strong></em> is out 11/11/11 through <a href=\"https://www.blbx.info/\" target=\"_blank\">BLBX</a>, hear some more of his stuff over at his <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/buffalo-tide\" target=\"_blank\">soundcloud</a>.
