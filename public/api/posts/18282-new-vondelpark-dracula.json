In the months that followed we’ve seen a series of remixes from the three-piece, an unprecedented amount actually, especially from a band that have shied away from the whole process. <em>Dracula</em> is our first taste of the LP, due out on <strong>R&S</strong> in spring 2013, a mournful yet uplifting love song that manages to be both tragic and exuberantly wistful in its convictions. In fact, wistful or indeed sublime, are 2 words that finally have a part to play in the description of Vondelpark’s music. The heady haze of the bedroom still acts as a backdrop to their world, only this this time the curtains have been opened, allowing bright city lights to finally enter the cave.</p>\n<p>[from <em>Seabed</em>; out in spring 2013 via R&S]</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F66494385&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18282-new-vondelpark-dracula","category":"music","date":1352393956000,"wpid":18282,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284522005,"updatedAt":1587825885306,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","categories":["music","new"]}
