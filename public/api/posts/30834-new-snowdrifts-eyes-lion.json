That said, their debut track, Eyes of a Lion is promising. It’s maybe a little too ‘vibey’, and verges upon ‘nice’ at times (way too much ‘nice’ music in 2015, i.e. doesn’t leave a lasting impression, just sort of drifts by), but there’s something here, and with a little development of sound, and a more distinctive take on the vocals, then yeah, could be cool.</p>\n<p>(I can’t remember who reposted this for it to appear on my Soundcloud feed, apologies if it was you)</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187869621&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30834-new-snowdrifts-eyes-lion","category":"music","date":1423601660000,"wpid":30834,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":50,"height":50,"src":"2015/02/10411196_340958806063346_8770319042502317991_n-50x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQII/8QAJBAAAgEDAwMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAURAxIhBhTRIjFhc5H/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//EABoRAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAAQMRMTL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AEdLpu2SdRJRRd6Evj2Un5qXiKHYLBhYB49A8VnK83W4MrI0+WU3EbTrNj8zQnfzBwJcjH2HzUawJdUIsV5Op//Z"},"createdAt":1587281679340,"updatedAt":1588403511286,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2015/02/10411196_340958806063346_8770319042502317991_n-50x50.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
