{"id":"5e9bf8158fb2d30d7769c924","title":"Introducing: WWWater","content":"<p>Having already collaborated with Soulwax through releases under her own name, Charlotte Adig√©ry aka <strong>WWWater</strong> steps out with her debut track under the newly birthed moniker.</p><p> The self-titled track serves as a fitting introduction to her twistedly ambitious sound, that manages to feel as much indebted to Portishead or Bjork as it does FKA Twigs, whilst existing entirely within a universe of its own. With more music expected later in the year, alongside live shows across Europe, WWWater is set for a busy next few months.
