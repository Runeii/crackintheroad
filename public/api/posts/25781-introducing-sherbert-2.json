Acting as a vehicle for Michelle Sullivan’s creativity, each track is a brief window into hazy days filled with boys, booze and narcotics in Nashville. Set to a forever 21 vibe of fuzzed-out garage guitar and narrated by Sullivan’s charming Tennessee drawl, it’s hard not to wish you were the arsehole she was singing about.</p>\n<p>[bandcamp width=100% height=120 album=1545773946 size=medium bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5]</p>\n","slug":"25781-introducing-sherbert-2","category":"introducing","date":1389125028000,"wpid":25781,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":471,"height":289,"src":"2014/01/1477974_188154004719847_1795446623_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMH/8QAGhABAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAEEQMCYf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A1xoWvSpZwXQ1lSp2DHtqfWIg6XXTP//Z"},"createdAt":1587282598230,"updatedAt":1588403522383,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d37","old_image":"2014/01/1477974_188154004719847_1795446623_n.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
