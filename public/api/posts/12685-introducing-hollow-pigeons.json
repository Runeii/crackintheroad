Straight out of Toronto, <strong>Ryan Dela Cruz</strong> aka <strong>Hollow Pigeons</strong> is creating some of the finest chillout music around at the moment. New EP, <strong><em>Birthdays</em></strong> is an eclectic mix of borrowed samples and blissed out melodies, forming a release that leaves a craving for repeated listens. Take<strong> More Affection</strong>, a jittery <strong>Evenings</strong> inspired number, washing luxuriously over the listener, before dropping a <strong>Baths</strong> (<em>Seaside Town</em> – originally taken from Kiki’s Delivery Service) sample into the track. Or there’s the spellbinding 1996 (presumably the year of <strong>Dela Cruz’s</strong> birth), which gradually builds up minimal inspired layers into a gorgeous cacophony of <strong>Balam Acab</strong>-esque sounds. With <strong>Hollow Pigeons</strong> still in his mid-teens, you can guarantee that this won’t be the last we hear from him.</p>\n<p>Check out a couple of choice picks from <em>Birthdays</em> below, and head over to his <a href=\"https://hollowpigeons.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> to grab the rest of the release for free.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27540370\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27540370\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hollowpigeons/more-affection\">More Affection</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hollowpigeons\">Hollow Pigeons</a></span> </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2411728750/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://hollowpigeons.bandcamp.com/track/1996\">1996 by Hollow Pigeons</a></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshdaltonn\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Follow @joshdaltonn</a><br />\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"vertical\" data-via=\"crackintheroad\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"12685-introducing-hollow-pigeons","category":"introducing","date":1321653808000,"wpid":12685,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293434905,"updatedAt":1587825910015,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
