On the flipside <em>Penny, You Are My Constant</em> sees <strong>T-Shirt Weather</strong> in <strong>Little Man Tate</strong> (remember them?) mode, brutally honest and charmingly uncouth. Check out both tracks below, oh, and guys, get a new logo, you’re going to need it.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2398728760/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14503-introducing-t-shirt-weather","category":"introducing","date":1328009417000,"wpid":14503,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":782,"height":632,"src":"2012/01/341903951-1.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587292974967,"updatedAt":1588403542511,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/01/341903951-1.png","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
