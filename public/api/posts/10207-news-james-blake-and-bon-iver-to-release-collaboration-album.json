Just under half an hour ago, the London producer and song-writer announced ’24 August 2011 – James Blake & Bon Iver – “Fall Creek Boys Choir”‘ on his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jamesblakemusic\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and Twitter pages. Rumours have already begun circulating that<strong> Blake</strong> is hinting at a possible collaboration between Wisconsin folk trio<strong> Bon Iver</strong>, and himself, which is a hugely enticing prospect. If the dates are correct, then this would allude to the record dropping next week, however several people have also raised questions about the announcement referring to a one off live show. Yet with <strong>Fall Creek</strong> being the name of the village in which <strong>Bon Iver’s</strong> sophomore record was recorded, there are suggestions that this collaboration album was created at the same location. As soon as we find out more we’ll let you know.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <strong>James Blake’s</strong> PR have told us <em>‘At this stage we can’t reveal any more information about it just yet but will let you know as and when we can.’</em></p>\n","slug":"10207-news-james-blake-and-bon-iver-to-release-collaboration-album","category":"music","date":1313594782000,"wpid":10207,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":338,"src":"2011/08/james-blake-new-music-video.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAHxAAAgICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAARByEiMUFR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQT/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDE//aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Atch2qdhngs0zLJUrLOJC+tB5ANAfe3zmqgttJDG69FZQQD62MYxog0S5Qf/Z"},"createdAt":1587294057302,"updatedAt":1588403550495,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/08/james-blake-new-music-video.jpg","categories":["music","news"]}
