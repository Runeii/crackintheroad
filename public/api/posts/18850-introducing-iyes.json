Earlier this month we saw the elegant debut track from <strong><a title=\"New: London Grammar – Hey Now\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/18774-new-london-grammar-hey-now/\">London Grammar</a></strong>, a wonderful pop song, that just about managed to shake its comparisons with anything <strong><a title=\"New: The xx – Chained (John Talabot & Pional Blinded Remix)\" href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18734-new-the-xx-chained-john-talabot-pional-blinded-remix/\">The xx</a></strong> has ever put out. This debut cut from Brighton’s <strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/weareiyes/\">IYES</a></strong> may yet have the same problems. On the surface these problems are entirely justified, a boy, a girl, talking about love, loss and pain. That’s what <strong>The xx</strong> do. Thankfully that’s not all that <strong>IYES</strong> want to do. Sure they want you to think about loss, that special someone that got away, but they also want to place you in a nightclub at 3am, gormlessly staring into a strobe light, wondering how the fuck you’re going to bounce back from it all. The xx don’t do that because they never tried. IYES tried.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F64699634\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18850-introducing-iyes","category":"introducing","date":1356608551000,"wpid":18850,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":652,"src":"2012/12/iyes.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIRAAAgEEAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBESIQAGIjEFE1H/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE/8QAGREBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACEiFR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDQX+N7Ek4+6unlKzK0ipOB44tnu2/IoQD6FxyhR0PckpIFC0b4ooylrZczr21tX/ba444Wt1U5FWMdz//Z"},"createdAt":1587284296810,"updatedAt":1588403534299,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/12/iyes.jpg","categories":["introducing","newmpfree","music","newnews"]}
