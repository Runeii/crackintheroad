O’Messy Life delivered a punchy and lyrical performance, veering between hard, aggressive music and more dreamlike moments.</p>\n<p>Acrobatic Society launched into a ferocious performance, almost offensive at first, as they pulled together hypnotic and entrancing syncopation into a beautiful and subtle mixture of brutal guitar and swooping strings. On record, the sound suffers a little, as with so many rather experimental rock-groups, but holds together as a pleasant and very listenable EP, at times somewhat reminiscent of Sunset Rubdown, at others comparable to the earlier jagged word of XTC. Eclectic and a little bit mad, future recordings should be something to keep an eye out for.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23475811\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23475811\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/acrobatic-society/rot\">Rot</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/acrobatic-society\">Acrobatic Society</a></span> </p>\n<p>(Image sourced from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jazzylemon\">Jazzy Lemon</a>)</p>\n","slug":"12001-introducing-acrobatic-society","category":"introducing","date":1319390350000,"wpid":12001,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":82,"src":"2011/10/as-165x82.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAFCAYAAAB8ZH1oAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAzklEQVR4nB3LsWrCUABA0aefINHPyKKjdFRMMtQhoGAaiKMicdQMUhUUtKEulQ4SOugSdNFBq5aXJQ7d2rXUT7mCwxmPaLdd4viLKDown78RBAHn84n/6x8/v9/E8YntboPQtRK+P8Xzusxmr8hIsl6HvPgTLhdJGC6R8hORSilUqxV0XadWs8jnH7As685xbBrNBsfjHpFIJEmnM2SzOQzDwPM61OvOPWmahqqqFApFhKJkME0T120xGg9Zrj5YLN7pD3o893uUy4/Y9hM3v6Z4Q68RJAsAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"createdAt":1587293657711,"updatedAt":1588403545875,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d35","old_image":"2011/10/as-165x82.png","categories":["introducing","live-reviews","music"]}
