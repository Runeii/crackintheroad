In that time I’ve witnessed a few more performances, as well as interviewing the group, and I can safely say that not only are they insanely talented, they’re some of the sweetest guys around. With two EPs out in 2010, the quirky four piece release their debut LP <em><strong>Illuminated People</strong></em> on 23 January via their own label, <a href=\"https://shaperecords.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shape Records</strong></a>. Their sound is a cataclysmic combination of influences, from <strong>Animal Collective</strong> to <strong>Foals</strong>, the group excel on the live stage, with their energetic performances being an all encompassing experience.
