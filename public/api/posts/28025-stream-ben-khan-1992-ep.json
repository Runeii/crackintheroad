From the murky, slightly ominous sounding Drive (Part 1) to the far more pop orientated swagger of Youth, it’s a mightily refreshing release. With the EP now out there for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/1992-ep/id843286438?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\" target=\"_blank\">purchase</a> and streaming, here’s hoping that the live show is just round the corner.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-content\"><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/31612380%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-PtvRh&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n","slug":"28025-stream-ben-khan-1992-ep","category":"music","date":1398181890000,"wpid":28025,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282187742,"updatedAt":1588441758155,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ffe0853169dfa21cee86d80de65e2f034f7d766a.jpg","categories":["music","stream","new"]}
