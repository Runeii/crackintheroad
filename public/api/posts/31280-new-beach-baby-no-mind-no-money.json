While ‘No Mind No Money’ operates on a hazier level than it’s predecessor, it is as infectious and marks a further evolution in the band’s very promising sound. Beach Baby may well just soundtrack your summer.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203765968&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31280-new-beach-baby-no-mind-no-money","category":"music","date":1431590428000,"wpid":31280,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587280330945,"updatedAt":1588442053287,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/7c9dd1b73db8754a8c52137e7ef0069dbef37f7b.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
