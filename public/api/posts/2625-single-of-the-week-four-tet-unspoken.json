This week’s single of the week, <em>‘Unspoken’</em>, taken from the 2003 LP <em>‘Rounds’</em> shows him at his most ambitious. Full of haunting and curious samples, the most infectious of melodies and ambitious gear changes, the piece is a musical trip that remains transcendent seven years later. So here it is in its nine and a half minutes of glory; prepare to be transported.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/fourtetkieranhebden\">Check out Four Tet’s Myspace</a></p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/5ViItcZyYBw?fs=1&hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/5ViItcZyYBw?fs=1&hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n","slug":"2625-single-of-the-week-four-tet-unspoken","category":"music","date":1283196259000,"wpid":2625,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2856,"height":1940,"src":"2010/08/fourtet-1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAIxAAAAUDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABRIGBzEIExQhIv/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAED/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAAhIhQf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AzLXv04Z39V44thjsPF7KbBA5SpZhAgp9BlMyHPFVN1IXDIcdK22J9SueaUo63LY1ISGp/9k="},"createdAt":1587295018842,"updatedAt":1588403564289,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2010/08/fourtet-1.jpg","categories":["music"]}
