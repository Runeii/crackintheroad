{"id":"5e9c2b8d9b6559241525d581","artists":["5e9b69517a1236eccfeb263c"],"title":"Introducing: Trap House Collective","content":"<p>Despite all it’s hype, grandeur and commercial success, <strong>Drake’s</strong> <em><strong>Take Care</strong></em> was one of my favourite LP’s of last year, and the influence of the Canadian artist is clearly stamped across these two debut tracks from Austin group <strong>Trap House Collective</strong>.</p><p> Presumably taking their name from the title of <strong>Gucci Mane’s</strong> debut record, I can’t find out too much about the group, with their <a href=\"https://traphousecollective.bandcamp.com/album/body-language-pt-1-songs-for-the-back-seat\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> page all I’ve been able to unearth. The two tracks up on said page are extremely promising R’n’B numbers, with the immaculate <em>Don’t Let Me Go</em> being my particular favourite with its slick sample and introspective verses. With both tracks listed under the title <strong><em>Body Language Pt.1: Songs For The Backseat</em></strong> indicating that there’s more to come; I’m extremely excited to hear the rest of the cuts set to feature on the release. Check out both tracks available so far below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=13238223/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13922-introducing-trap-house-collective","category":"introducing","date":1326815095000,"wpid":13922,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293069314,"updatedAt":1587825905864,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
