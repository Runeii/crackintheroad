Their early tracks, <strong><em>Feelin’ Dank</em></strong> and <strong><em>Friend Crash</em></strong> seemed thin in terms of vocals and lacked that punchy groove that I was looking for. Still, I felt alone, isolated even, so it was a great relief when the band dropped <strong><em>I’m His Girl</em></strong> about a week ago. The track is perhaps one of the most boisterously street smart and gloriously empowered pieces of pop I’ve heard in a long time. The bass line pumps and bops, while the actually pretty intricate vocal arrangements flirt and dictate to the listener,<strong><em> “when you see me walking around with him/I’m not just some other chick”.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The single’s B-side compliments <strong><em>I’m His Girl</em></strong> Perfectly. The cover of <strong>Ghost Town DJs’ <em>My Boo</em></strong> isn’t exactly the most polished cover ever, yet it’s fun and adventurous, two words that sum up the band perectly.</p>\n<p>Stream the 2 tracks below and check out the band in London on the 27<sup>th</sup> (<strong>The Hoxton Square Bar and Kitchen</strong>) and 28<sup>th</sup> (<strong>The Shacklewell Arms</strong>) of September.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23253035\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23253035\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23840097\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23840097\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"11470-new-friends-im-his-girlmy-boo","category":"music","date":1316721298000,"wpid":11470,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":904,"height":601,"src":"2011/09/friends.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAIRAAAgEDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAMFBhExEhMUIkH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBf/EABoRAQABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhIyQfD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJWk9H4+ZjWvTJF7aMq+UigevUdlKn6OBWRuYKUlx1XtlQSASeaUpqcklRCwe1P/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293784254,"updatedAt":1588403547130,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/09/friends.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
