{"id":"5e9c2b749b6559241525d571","artists":["5e9b68c77a1236eccfeb1dac"],"title":"Introducing: And The Moon Be Still As Bright","content":"<p>Taking his name from Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles (I assume),<strong> And The Moon Be Still As Bright</strong> is seemingly a bizarre act to ‘introduce’ as he already has pretty much an albums worth of material under his belt.</p><p> I initially held back on writing about <strong>ATMBSAB</strong> as I couldn’t find out any information on him whatsoever, but as luck would have it, <a href=\"https://www.soundonthesound.com/2012/01/16/and-the-moon-be-still-and-bright-new-solo-songs-from-the-lonely-forests-john-van-deusen/\" target=\"_blank\">Sound on the Sound</a> discovered that this project is indeed an offshoot for <strong>John Van Deusen</strong> of the much hyped group <strong>The Lonely Forest</strong>.</p>\n<p>These debut track from <strong>Deusen</strong> are slightly rougher round the edges, yet still very worthy of hearing in their own right. There’s the anthemic <strong>M83</strong>-esque <em>Snow Covered Flowers</em> and the gloriously upbeat <em>Master Works (The Waves)</em>, showing the diversity that <strong>ATMBSAS</strong> possess. Lyrically there’s much to admire as well, take <em>Master Works</em>; <em>‘I could sit before the sea in write a novel in my head, wouldn’t be nearly as good as all the stories I have read’</em> which when accompanied by <strong>Deusen’s</strong> imperfect vocals, conjures up magically imagery. My personal favourites being <em>Mass Effection</em>, an indie-pop gem that any band would be proud of recording and the wonderfully shoegaze inclined <em>Sinking</em>. All in all, there’s much to enjoy about these ten tracks, and they certainly showcase a vast amount of potential; if only they were available to download.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3785333087/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe><br />\n<iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3580481661/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe><br />\n<iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3625217029/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14291-introducing-and-the-moon-be-still-as-bright","category":"introducing","date":1326987418000,"wpid":14291,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293044530,"updatedAt":1587825905484,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
