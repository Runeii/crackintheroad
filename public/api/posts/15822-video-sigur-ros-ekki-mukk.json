With over 150,000 views of lead track <em>Ekki Múkk</em> in under 24 hours, it’s obvious that they aren’t the only ones anticipating their return. <strong>Jónsi’s</strong> vocals are as refined and biblically elegant as ever, whilst the instrumentation showcases the ‘drone’ inspirations that the group have talked about recently. The tranquil, minimal visuals come courtesy of <strong>Jónsi’s</strong> sister, <em>Inga Birgisdóttir</em> and are as hypnotizing and gloriously bewitching as the music. Check out <em>Ekki Múkk</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/39194761?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=ffffff\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/39194761\">Sigur Rós – Ekki múkk</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/sigurros\">Sigur Rós</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n","slug":"15822-video-sigur-ros-ekki-mukk","category":"music","date":1332847205000,"wpid":15822,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292616198,"updatedAt":1588441779641,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/screen-shot-2012-03-27-at-13.17.51-950x515.png","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
