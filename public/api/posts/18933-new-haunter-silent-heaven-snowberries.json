Check out both new tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=925548447/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18933-new-haunter-silent-heaven-snowberries","category":"mpfree","date":1357241276000,"wpid":18933,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284255264,"updatedAt":1588441772175,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/9b7cc78b65e03afcb2c3a4a79e0a4e9815308deb.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
