Check out the remix below, and the original underneath that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F110797758\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F107681575\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24273-new-1975-somebody-can-watch-dream-koala-remix","category":"music","date":1379366197000,"wpid":24273,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282966155,"updatedAt":1588441762477,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/a318b8a8799662a1c0833103650b21c88370957c.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
