With their most recent release, <strong>Comedown Machine</strong>, it appears that the unity, talent and unbreakable friendships that made them such an exciting group in the early-mid-00’s, has completely disappeared. Now, without wanting to downplay the quality of this new jam from Knoxville’s <strong>Nomadic Firs</strong> aka <strong>Ryan Boos</strong>, there’s more than a hint of the New York rockers to it, yet infused with his own unique, upbeat brand of pop, that brought him so much attention on the blog-classic Vines. <em>Lavish Hush</em> is less slick chillwave, more of a gritty, heartfelt, rush to the head, with Boos utilizing a gravely New York City Cops-style delivery; it’s a track that almost feels like it could have been tagged on the end of <em><strong>Is This It</strong></em>, and that’s by no means a bad thing.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F86171937\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20814-new-nomadic-firs-lavish-hush","category":"mpfree","date":1365121890000,"wpid":20814,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283663383,"updatedAt":1588441767343,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/bc222ceadf43657c6d1b3e2453aaafe0a333b530.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
