{"id":"5e9c2dbd9b6559241525d758","artists":["5e9b69047a1236eccfeb213b"],"title":"New: Hot Sugar – Da Paperboy","content":"<p>This guy is a bit of a wizard when it comes to electronics.</p><p> Watch any of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hotsugarcoated\" target=\"_blank\">his stuff on YouTube</a> and you’ll get the idea how this guy shouldn’t just be dismissed as just another bedroom producer. In fact, he must be good – <strong>The Roots</strong> have hired him to co-produce for a track on their new album with <strong>RJD2</strong>‘s new partner in crime, <strong>Aaron Livingston</strong>. I’ve heard really really good bedroom producers before but this guy takes the piss a little.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Da Paperboy</strong></em> is 90’s Sega music all the way, but updated for a current mindset. This guy can make it more than that too – he takes it past just your average 16-bit odyssey and into headbobbing beat territory. I’d happily listen to this whilst at breakfast eating my cereal just as much as I’d love to hear this forced through the speakers at a house party. He seems to make some of the most badass kids music, temptations of pretension pushed aside. And there’s not one bit I don’t like about that. Keep both ears on this.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Da Paperboy below.</em></p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26248942&show_comments=true&auto_play=false&color=000000\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26248942&show_comments=true&auto_play=false&color=000000\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"12065-new-hot-sugar-da-paperboy","category":"music","date":1319636433000,"wpid":12065,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":111,"src":"2011/10/279715_10150332534717419_41392767418_10117134_4130200_o-165x111.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHRAAAgIDAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFIRFRB//EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/8QAGBEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECETH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AKXZfr1TVtc2llLraxp4YoolVSyDxix798+5slcGxXimi7HIodSecI9GMZewqDWW0f/Z"},"createdAt":1587293629054,"updatedAt":1588403545770,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/10/279715_10150332534717419_41392767418_10117134_4130200_o-165x111.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
