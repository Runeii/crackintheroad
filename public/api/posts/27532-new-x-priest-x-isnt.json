Cleaner, more refined, yet equally as bubble-gum sweet, X Priest X are all set for the big time, and Isn’t It So may well be the track to help give them that push. Check it out below, and keep your eyes out for the full EP, out 15 April.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140523962&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27532-new-x-priest-x-isnt","category":"music","date":1395446512000,"wpid":27532,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":766,"height":800,"src":"2014/03/1468809_181609812032280_937116027_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAALAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQf/xAAhEAACAQMEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEESEABQYSFFFhcf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAGREBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARAgMx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwB/ksMrrFVQVMsM0LqEs9kPZrHuLZBwPmmjCLnOoHWbrXAbi/lzF6hOkhLXLDspt8z60vS8t3zxYb7g5PQZKKScfmr4tLcbuHhP/9k="},"createdAt":1587282321643,"updatedAt":1588403517469,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/03/1468809_181609812032280_937116027_n.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
