With that said, there are still the trademark subtleties within ‘When The World Screamed’ that will stir immediate references of Hot Chip in the mind of the listener, along with a plethora of 80’s pop classics. What’s more, you can download the track for free below.</p>\n<p>Another positive step forward for an exciting new act, and you can catch them live on the 21st February at Nottingham’s Jam Cafe.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129474349&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26014-new-april-towers-world-screamed","category":"music","date":1389706052000,"wpid":26014,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2014/01/april-towers1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGCP/EACAQAAMAAgIDAAMAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFBhEAITEiQXH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AkOc8v3EOe7/FTnW11+NPLuqymKlZdN+KDo9Efz515pfiOXW/FNLauQ+RSmFF2s7e6EzUlj377P3wC/GdDk5FrZOk1lrUYs9KYk2ZifpJI9nx7jRlHHlKM0nJFCoiKAFAHQAH6HlXB//Z"},"createdAt":1587282564145,"updatedAt":1588403521667,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2014/01/april-towers1.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
