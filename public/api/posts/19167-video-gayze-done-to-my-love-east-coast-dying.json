A real 60’s throwback, <strong>Gayze</strong> are slick, (at times) raucous and utterly immersive, yet there’s a more sinister side to their music that Tyler enhances brilliantly. The ability of<strong> Williams</strong> to narrate a story without overwhelming the viewer with details is second to none, a trait that lends his entire catalogue of work to repeated plays. Check out the visuals below, then grab <strong>Gayze’s</strong> fantastic debut release <a href=\"https://bleedinggoldrecords.bandcamp.com/album/bg036-black-soul\" target=\"_blank\">Black Soul</a>.
