Smog)’s latest album should be a welcome treat to anybody who has heard his work previously. Building on the success of recent work, Apocalypse sees Bill Callahan move away from the obvious hooks present in many of the riffs on Sometimes I Wish We Were An Eagle, and exploring a more diverse musical palette.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy wistful melodic folk/blues, Bill Callahan might just become your new favourite artist if you weren’t aware of him before. Sentimental and sensitive without descending into languorous angst, Bill Callahan directs the mood of each song with expertise. As for the sound, I could quite happily listen to the entire album with everything but Bill Callahan’s beautiful purr of a voice muted, but the instrumentation compliments his voice fantastically, particularly on piano-led ballad One Fine Morning, resulting in a moving, soothing and generally satisfying album.</p>\n<p>Unless you are of the belief that all music needs to be loud and heavy, get this beautiful album as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Tracks to listen to: Drover, Riding For The Feeling, One Fine Morning</p>\n","slug":"6616-review-bill-callahan-apocalypse","category":"music","date":1302894469000,"wpid":6616,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294509211,"updatedAt":1588441789542,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d35","old_image":"2011/04/callahan-apocalypse-188x188.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
