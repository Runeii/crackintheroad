What <strong>Blanco</strong> does is different, his character is brash, bitchy and aggressive just like the fore mentioned artists but the difference is simple. Those artists want to change the world, <strong>Blanco</strong> wants to own it.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F66425777&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18285-new-mykki-blanco-kingpinning-ice-cold-prod-by-brenmar","category":"music","date":1352395583000,"wpid":18285,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284519912,"updatedAt":1588441773857,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/f9ef64142f5edca4f294681d2e9968fd863e591b.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
