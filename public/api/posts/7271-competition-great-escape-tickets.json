One of the most exciting festivals that kicks off this wonderful time of year is <strong>The Great Escape </strong>festival set in Brighton. Claiming to be Europe’s leading festival for new music, this years line up sees the like of <strong>Friendly Fires </strong>(pictured), <strong>Sufjan Stevens </strong>and <strong>DJ Shadow </strong>as headliners. However it is the immense amount of independent and unsigned talent that will be performing between the <strong>12th </strong>to the <strong>14th May </strong>that truly raises <strong>The Great Escape </strong>above most other festivals.</div>\n<div>As to celebrate this fantastic festival, we are giving away two pairs of tickets to <strong>The Great Escape</strong>.
