{"id":"5e9c2efb9b6559241525d901","title":"Introducing – The Rifts","content":"<p>Bandcamp is a cruel mistress, as she teases you with rare occasions of an undiscovered talent, though more often than not she simply serves you up a plentiful portion of despair in what many people consider worth sharing with the world.</p><p> However last night I found myself on the kinder and more fortunate side of her volatile personality, and I was rewarded with the ambient hip-hop stylings of <strong>The Rifts</strong>.</p>\n<p>A quartet based in San Bernardino, California, <strong>The Rifts </strong>debut release <strong>Cherry Blossoms </strong>proves a very intriguing first listen. Beginning with a track paradoxically entitled ‘Departure’, the vocals are reminiscent of the gravely stylings of <strong>Eels</strong>, before then bursting into verses of intimate and smooth rap. Cementing this altogether is a finely orchestrated soundtrack of guitar riffs and etheral synths that establish the beautiful hybrid nature of <strong>The Rifts </strong>sound. It is this fusion of genres and styles that elevates <strong>Cherry Blossoms </strong>above the efforts of many similar artists, and most excitingly it promises a considerable level of potential for an even more developed and crafted full length release.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1601464583/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10798-introducing-the-rifts","category":"introducing","date":1314946850000,"wpid":10798,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293947531,"updatedAt":1588441790764,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273b3410c496180c810245f348e.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","music","reviews"]}
