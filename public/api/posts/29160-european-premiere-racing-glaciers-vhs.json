Achieving an almost unprecedented amount of <a href=\"https://hypem.com/search/racing%20glaciers/1/\" target=\"_blank\">Hype Machine</a> success for a more traditional rock and roll outfit, alongside Radio 1 play for recent singles <em>First Light</em> and<em> Moths</em>, they’re a surefire tip for colossal success in 2015. Newest track,<em> VHS</em>, is another explosive outing, centred around a riff that would see Royal Blood turn green with envy, and their hearts-on-sleeves approach to lyricism; this may well signal the beginning of a more mainstream breakthrough. Check out <em>VHS</em> below and grab a free download from their <a href=\"https://www.musicglue.com/racing-glaciers/\" target=\"_blank\">Music Glue</a> page, plus keep your eyes peeled for their third EP, out 18 August.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/158796456&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29160-european-premiere-racing-glaciers-vhs","category":"music","date":1405380647000,"wpid":29160,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282050192,"updatedAt":1588441756054,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/d17d2a2c559b339be01b320a2aadebfa6fa11624.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
