Around then I noticed that there was actually a band standing around on stage, and that some kind of spoken word intro was playing over the PA. About half an hour later I found myself stood dazed, much closer to the stage, wondering what had just happened. I asked someone what the band were called. ‘<strong>Palm Reader</strong>‘, came the response.</p>\n<p>As you’ll soon discover from <em>War Between The Head And The Heart</em>, <strong>Palm Reader </strong>are kind of at odds with the kind of thing we normally cover at CitR, but really, I have a massive soft spot for the rock’n’roll infused hardcore that the Woking-based five piece<strong> </strong>ply their trade in, if not the posturing that’s contributed to the downfall of that scene over the last decade or so. To make use of that tired old warhorse of rock writing, think <strong>Everytime I Die </strong>in a bar fight with <strong>Drowningman</strong>, or something. And see them live. For fuck’s sake, see them live.
