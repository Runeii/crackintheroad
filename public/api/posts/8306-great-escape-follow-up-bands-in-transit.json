Based on the premise of bandâ€™s spending months, if not years, lugging their own equipment around the nation in the back of transits, a select number of artists were invited to record a session in the back of one of the said vans. Below are two rather good sessions with <strong>Ed Sheeran </strong>and <strong>James Vincent McMorrow</strong>, however you can watch all the sessions at <strong><a href=\"https://bandsintransit.com/index.php/\" target=\"_blank\">Bands In Transit</a></strong><a href=\"https://bandsintransit.com/index.php/\" target=\"_blank\">.</a></p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/EnUK1UmZgRY?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/EnUK1UmZgRY?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/eedW8s3mkUg?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/eedW8s3mkUg?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n","slug":"8306-great-escape-follow-up-bands-in-transit","category":"festivals","date":1307015915000,"wpid":8306,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294329875,"updatedAt":1588441789075,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2011/06/james-vincent-292x50.jpg","categories":["festivals","music","reviews"]}
