Take the terrifyingly upbeat<em> ’71</em>, that’s part<strong> Beach Boys</strong>, part<strong> Best Coast</strong> and 100% awesome. It’s not until the final track on the EP, the sombre <em>Half of a Century</em>, that they take their foot off the gas, slowing things down to a sultry, percussion heavy walk, whilst maintaing their rhythmic swagger. Check out the full EP now, and grab a pay-what-you-like download. Trust me, it’s worth it.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3155716519/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18728-new-the-delphines-god-help-the-delphines-ep","category":"mpfree","date":1355496762000,"wpid":18728,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284341093,"updatedAt":1588441772521,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273bce338ced0e063608aa4a3c6.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
