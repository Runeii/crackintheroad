It’s hugely engaging and requires repeat listens to fully appreciate the density and intricacy of each track, almost like they’ve been pieced together from a vast, far more imposing puzzle.</p>\n<p>The five minute epically haphazard <em>Stan</em> jumps sporadically between half beats and sampled female vocals, never really opening out into a full on jam, yet remaining truly elegant. As a debut release, it’s extremely accomplished, and quite possibly one of my favourite EPs of the year thus far. Each track appears chopped and diced beyond recognition however it works, portrayed perfectly by <em>Dobre Myśli</em>; one of those rare pieces of music that requires your complete, undivided attention.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2807185582/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1697459432/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Head over to <strong>Baklu’s</strong> bandcamp for a free download of <strong><em>Demo B</em></strong>, and check out a couple of tracks below.</p>\n<p>Image sourced from <a href=\"https://perforatedthinking.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Perforated Thinking</a>.</p>\n","slug":"11890-introducing-baklu","category":"introducing","date":1319407479000,"wpid":11890,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293655466,"updatedAt":1588441787825,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/e2e4dbee2f8c4d9571e7a034488328c8bddb9f4d.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
