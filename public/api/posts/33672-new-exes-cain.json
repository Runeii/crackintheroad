Their latest track, <em>Cain</em>, perfectly encapsulates the sense of a relationship never fully embraced, and manages to make the fragility and devastation of it all sound beautiful.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/325377504&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33672-new-exes-cain","category":"music","date":1496931538000,"wpid":33672,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"src":"2017/06/artworks-000225142840-71n639-original.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQYHCP/EACMQAAECBgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAwAEBQYREiEHE0FCUWH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AGm67kueQq11U+TGfJp2pj2CQHSMG9W+W1T1RUXhP2I/UZnqM5UJk23bv0J0lHQplBxlcYTwkbdUA231Hb7jmDmCJc6f/9k="},"createdAt":1587279849750,"updatedAt":1588403500301,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/06/artworks-000225142840-71n639-original.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
