In a year when UK festivals seem to have relatively poor line ups compared to previous years, it is good to see <strong>Michael Eavis </strong>really pushing the boat out, especially in terms of the variety of artists featured. <strong>Glastonbury </strong>takes place between 25th-27th June, and is already completely sold out. We want to hear from you if you are going, what do you think of the line up?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The full line up can be found<a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/\"> here.</a></p>\n","slug":"267-glastonbury-2010","category":"festivals","date":1271261884000,"wpid":267,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587295355924,"updatedAt":1587825939323,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["festivals","music"]}
