This steady progress led to the release of the project’s first proper EP ‘<strong>Gone Blind</strong>‘ early this year, with all the hype now surrounding <strong>Porcelain Raft</strong>‘s album due out later this year. Indulging in spectral indie pop, <strong>Porcelain Raft </strong>has created a sound that is as beautiful as it is distorted, and full of atmospheric melodies. His support for the evening came from <strong>Daniel Blumberg</strong>, a.k.a. the lead singer of <strong>Yuck</strong>, and you can read a fantastic introducing article about him <strong><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/5793-introducing-oupa\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Oupa:</strong></p>\n<p>Unassumingly sat behind a keyboard, <strong>Blumberg </strong>struck a figure of an awkward and shy individual, speaking in hushed tones to the small assembled audience. However once <strong>Blumberg </strong>began to perform, a quiet intensity began to build as he performed a set of tracks underscored by a soft and ominous score of piano and raw vocals which created a tragically beautiful sound. A sharp shift away from the brash nature of <strong>Yuck, </strong>with <strong>Oupa Blumberg </strong>has taken it’s core essence and stripped back the veneer of distortion to reveal a vulnerable, yet immensely powerful sound. Particular favourites of the night were ‘<strong>Forget</strong>‘ and a cover of an untitled track by <strong>Porcelain Raft</strong>.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11463222&\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11463222&\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object><span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oupamusic/forget\">Forget</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oupamusic\">oupa</a></span></p>\n<p>8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Porcelain Raft:</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to <strong>Porcelain Raft</strong>‘s performance, <strong>Mauro </strong>informed me that, after a sound check, he had decided to perform his set as acoustically as he could. I was intrigued by how <strong>Mauro </strong>would transfer the sound of <strong>Porcelain Raft </strong>to that of something wholly quiet and calmer, however, as he later proved, I had nothing to worry about. Positioned in the centre of the small stage, <strong>Mauro </strong>moved between keyboard, electric guitar and sampler with a gentle ease that matched smooth transitions that run within his tracks. With a level of blissful serenity, <strong>Mauro </strong>began a set that created a beauty in it’s level of orchestration alone. <strong>Mauro</strong>‘s falsetto vocals cascaded amongst touches of distorted synth, bursts of samples and powerful piano, which were all linked together with the most intricate of timing. A particular highlight of the set, ‘<strong>Talk To Me</strong>‘, demonstrates the sound <strong>Mauro </strong>has created ventures between the realms of darkness and light, finding itself within the beautifully mysterious and the surreal. A fantastic performance that found its strengths in the sublime subtleties of <strong>Porcelain Raft</strong>‘s sound.</p>\n<p>9/10</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/porcelainraft\" target=\"_blank\">Porcelain Raft MySpace</a></strong></p>\n","slug":"6031-review-porcelain-raftoupa-manchester","category":"music","date":1301497094000,"wpid":6031,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":620,"height":372,"src":"2011/03/porcelain-raft.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIBAAAgAGAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFETEGEhMhQf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAZEQEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAEEEVH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AKm4c/tt1vUvkVHT3WVPoJvhRGqeqPLljLgoMjLdgPuo2MOXAddN7GdwhB2VpWu+xHUCaPJ//9k="},"createdAt":1587294568133,"updatedAt":1588403558007,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2011/03/porcelain-raft.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
