One Glove) or the less so opinion splitting, The Postal Service","content":"<p>Colorado outfit <strong>We Can Swim</strong> impress on their debut track, <em>A House Built On Lies (ft.</p><p> One Glove)</em>. Grounded by a the sort of beat that characterised much of <strong>Owl City’s</strong> critically controversial album (or the less so opinion splitting, The Postal Service), and a female vocal not too far from the sugary sweet perfection of an Ellie Goulding or a Little Boots.
