With it’s dream-pop tendencies and ethereal influences, the vocal driven number has already been featured by our blog bro’s <a href=\"https://www.lostlostlost.com/2011/12/lockets-camera-shy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lostx3</a>, and I’m certain that the coverage of this gorgeous first cut from Todd and Dani will continue to find it’s way round the internet. For me, <em>Camera Shy</em> really hits it’s top speed when the stunning guitar section comes in at around the three minute mark, elevating it far above being just ‘another chillwave inspired track’.
