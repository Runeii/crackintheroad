The track echoes everything great about Merchandise’s previous records, particularly Carson Cox’s unmistakable vocals. It does however, takes a more laid back approach to previous songs which have felt rooted in punk music. This track features echoes of saxophones, giving the track an almost jazz-like feel about it. 2014 is going to be a big year for this band.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.4ad.com/news/14/1/2014/4adwelcomemerchandisedebut12nowavailableforpreorder\">4AD website</a> for more.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/mfbaAesfbTg]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfbaAesfbTg\"> </a></p>\n","slug":"26107-new-merchandise-begging-lifein-city-light","category":"new","date":1389976844000,"wpid":26107,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":898,"src":"2014/01/merch.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAJAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYHCP/EACUQAAEDBAECBwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQABRESQQexBhQzNDVyc//EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAHREBAAEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACERIDBBMkMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AI2a8sdQ78/DlMpjRGlEAsskFCUp2I24JUDjPFM58LXskmIY/lj6W9vbKteMnk4qQdNPk7n93e1aVgexj/mntQtF5hylnuetTTgCeWS8//9k="},"createdAt":1587282547933,"updatedAt":1588403521348,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0c","old_image":"2014/01/merch.jpg","categories":["new"]}
