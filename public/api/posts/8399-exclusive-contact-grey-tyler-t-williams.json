This soundtrack inspires what <strong>Williams </strong>describes as ‘vivid vignettes of isolation and despair from haunting nightmares of the past’. Presented with the solitary character of a troubled man, <strong>Jeffrey Echols</strong>, the film displays his sustained mental break down as the narrator gives the viewer an intimate insight into <strong>Echols </strong>thoughts. Based around the paranoia and questioning born out of the extraterrestrial happenings in the USA during the 50’s, the film stands as a metaphor of trying to find truth in a time of ambiguity and conspiracy, only for <strong>Echols </strong>to dig too deep.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/24436908?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&autoplay=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"255\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"8399-exclusive-contact-grey-tyler-t-williams","category":"arts","date":1307442665000,"wpid":8399,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294311289,"updatedAt":1588441788937,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2011/06/tyler-t-williams-292x50.png","categories":["arts"]}
