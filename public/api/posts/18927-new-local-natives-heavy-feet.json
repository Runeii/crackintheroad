Having never been a particularly big fan of their previous material, I’ve been shocked by just how much I’ve enjoyed their rebranded epic-indie-pop. So it’ll probably find it’s way onto daytime radio, and most likely, the summer festival circuit, but at this moment in time, there’s few other bands I’d want to see blasting out anthems to a field full of merry festival-goers. Check out<em> Heavy Feet</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73389892\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18927-new-local-natives-heavy-feet","category":"music","date":1357221784000,"wpid":18927,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284265146,"updatedAt":1588441772232,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/f1f253b8023f429dd8ce69b23d0445d6a88a6879.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
