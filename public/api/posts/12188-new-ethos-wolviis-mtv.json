Mixing the down-tempo production values of <strong>Youth Lagoon</strong> with the reverb laden surf-pop inspired vocals akin to the likes of <strong>Wavves</strong>, <em>MTV</em> is a stunning first outing from the duo. It’s one of those tracks that leaves you feeling slightly lost once it finishes and longing for something to fill the expansive void of mundane life. The lyrics are fairly desolate and despairing, but not to the point of detracting from the beauty of the overall sound, ending on the heart-breaking line ‘<em>paranoia all day and night, I just can’t stay</em>‘. Simply put, <em>MTV</em> is musical bliss.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1228312602/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12188-new-ethos-wolviis-mtv","category":"introducing","date":1319975854000,"wpid":12188,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":350,"height":350,"src":"2011/10/1299586670-1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQFB//EACIQAAEDAwQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIBBBEAAxIFITFBBxMXIv/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABES/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCrrnmqNRtOWrJyDVA9VxvdRNyzlDSOFjaj7OfTd3HX5GsfvGR55kRQS8rPdNiq4puvFCqsv//Z"},"createdAt":1587293595601,"updatedAt":1588403545329,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/10/1299586670-1.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
