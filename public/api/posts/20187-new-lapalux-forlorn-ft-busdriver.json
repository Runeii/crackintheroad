Busdriver)","content":"<p><strong>Lapalux</strong>’s debut LP, <em>Nostalchic</em>, is just around the corner, due out this month via <strong>Brainfeeder</strong>.</p><p> <em>Forlorn</em> wont appear on the album, but is certainly worth a listen on its own merits. To start with, <strong>Busdriver</strong>, goes fucking hard, twisting and turning at an alarming rate around Lapalux’s blissed and serine beat with a remarkable amount of vigour when the speed of his flow is factored in. It’s an accomplishment in itself, yet <strong>Busdriver</strong> also has a lot to stay, speedballing through themes and issues with ease and care. It’s an interesting if not odd pairing, yet certainly welcome all the same.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F81204533\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20187-new-lapalux-forlorn-ft-busdriver","category":"music","date":1362125055000,"wpid":20187,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283843994,"updatedAt":1588441769372,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/2d5c81ee7a37399c15b81aaf3930f1c4f7a1afa1.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
