The societal assumption is often a condescending one, when in fact these musicians are some of the most talented that I have ever worked with. It was important to bring this sentiment into the the public domain – so the greater population can begin to understand that by patronising and feeling awkward towards visually-impaired people it only further reinforces a feeling they might have of ‘being different’.”</p>\n<p><em>Blindfold</em> works alongside the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) which helps to assist over 2 million people each year whom are affected by various degrees of visual impairments. The full documentary and track can be seen here:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mn_FrSRVhBo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31127-new-marie-naffah-blindfold","category":"music","date":1427462550000,"wpid":31127,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587280357433,"updatedAt":1588441753112,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d09","old_image":"generated/d0dcfa651b28238be23fbf44b3f10f8406f7ea14.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
