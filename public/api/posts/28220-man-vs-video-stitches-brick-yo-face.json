Everything about it speaks to me: the women, the houses, the lifestyle. I mean, I’ve never actually finished the film, but I don’t see it ending badly.</p>\n<p>Well, turns out I’m in luck. The video for ‘Brick In Yo Face’ by the Miami-based Stitches is tailor made for those of us who want a simple guide to conducting yourself in the drug trade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Get face tattoos</strong><br />\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-28216\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2014/05/photo-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"photo 1\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-1-300x225.png 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-1-50x38.png 50w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-1.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<p>How can you deal gak if you don’t look the part? Personally, I wouldn’t consider buying any Colombian marching powder unless the dude shotting it has a gun, or at the very least a knife or baton, inked across his face.</p>\n<p>Think of the police as well. Are they really gonna arrest a fella with an AK-47 on his cheek for dealing drugs? Unlikely. They’ll probably try and get you on weapons charges instead. On that note…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>You need guns. Lots of guns.</strong></p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-28217\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-2-1024x768.png\" alt=\"photo 2\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-2-1024x768.png 1024w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-2-300x225.png 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-2-50x38.png 50w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-2.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" />\n<p>Anyone who says you shouldn’t mix violence and drugs is a pussy and should stop reading this right away.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Live for your profession</strong><br />\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28222\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/love-selling-blow.gif\" alt=\"love selling blow\" width=\"600\" height=\"317\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stringent quality control</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-28218\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-3-1024x768.png\" alt=\"photo 3\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-3-1024x768.png 1024w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-3-300x225.png 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-3-50x38.png 50w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/05/photo-3.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></strong><br />\nIf you have an inferior product, you’re not gonna sell any.
