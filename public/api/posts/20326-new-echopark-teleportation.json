Infectiously upbeat, you can almost feel rays of  sunlight pervade through the driving percussion, however Forte takes great care in never letting you rest in a bored comfort, rather you’re kept in a state of an enjoyably intriguing flux.</p>\n<p>Download ‘Teleportation’ for free <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/enclaves/echopark-teleportation-1/\">here.</a></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F78936535\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20326-new-echopark-teleportation","category":"music","date":1362691739000,"wpid":20326,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283798157,"updatedAt":1588441768776,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273180e1211b200e979f44ecc3f.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
