Anyway, having conquered my pretentious demons, I decided that Brisbane’s <strong>Dear Anonymous</strong> is just too good to not be heard. Drifting from melancholic piano ballads (<em>Only Ones</em>) to <strong>Antlers</strong>-esque lullaby’s (<em>Awkward</em>), the three piece comprised of <strong>Julia Kourtidis</strong> (piano/vocals),<strong> Rob Knaggs</strong> (cello) and <strong>Ben Tilney</strong> (guitar) are a further jewel in the constantly expanding crown that is Australia’s music scene. Check out their debut EP <strong><em>Songs For Chuck And Blair</em></strong> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1097954409/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16813-introducing-dear-anonymous","category":"introducing","date":1338981390000,"wpid":16813,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285139668,"updatedAt":1588441777254,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2735e09d9b82342b30d9c494650.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
