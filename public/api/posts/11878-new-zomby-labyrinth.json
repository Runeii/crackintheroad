I found it to be weaker than a lot of his past stuff on <strong>Hyperdub</strong>, <strong>Ramp Recordings</strong> and <strong>Werk Discs</strong>. So what he’s cheekily done now is get a Japanese bonus disc that came with <strong><em>Dedication</em></strong>, and put it on wax over here in the West. The bastard.</p>\n<p>But I’m not gonna complain after hearing this taster. The usual rave elements are there, but this time with a devilish portion of hardcore chime powering melodically through the track, like a slowed down jungle classic. The formula may be familiar but take a step back and it’s one of his most nostalgic productions yet. If this is what we’re gonna get from this new EP, entitled <em><strong>Nothing</strong></em>, then I think I’ll expect more than just nothing.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Labyrinth below.
