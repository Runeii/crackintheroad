Predominantly organ driven, it’s a worthwhile and timely reminder of Vernon’s immense talent as both as a musician and a songwriter.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KbJy1zeoDn4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"8035-new-bon-iver-calgary","category":"music","date":1305673642000,"wpid":8035,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":650,"height":435,"src":"2011/05/bon-iver-pr-2009use.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMG/8QAIBAAAgEEAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFEQYhBxMxof/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIF/8QAGxEAAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABBBMRMUH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALePMlZ8oiGJ90q5ERidGlLEOoJ0wI6B6+HQ1oVqJeE3byuzXFmSWJJMbd/tKVMlNUWB6lYT7X//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294371234,"updatedAt":1588403555331,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/05/bon-iver-pr-2009use.jpg","categories":["music"]}
