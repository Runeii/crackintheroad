If there is one criticism you could wager against Mount Weak, is that there are no huge shifts in dynamic between the tracks that have been presented. With that said, with each one taken in their own right it is difficult to not get lost within the serenity.</p>\n","slug":"28498-introducing-mount-weak","category":"introducing","date":1400155965000,"wpid":28498,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282142321,"updatedAt":1588441757431,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/0b8555d76b757b128f19c78b0567f3b69aa93a2b.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
