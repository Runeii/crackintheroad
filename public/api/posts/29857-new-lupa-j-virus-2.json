{"id":"5e9bffdf774c2610387e458e","artists":["5e9b691e7a1236eccfeb22c5"],"title":"New: Lupa J – Virus","content":"<p>Immense is surely the only word fair to accurately describe the new track from <strong>Lupa J</strong>.</p><p> A classical violinist with an emerging penchant for spiralling synths and ghostly beats, <em>Virus</em> is an upwards journey into the realms of “electronica, folktronica and indie pop” (Triple J Unearthed) for which it knows no bounds. It almost catches you by surprise; with every break the track gives more, adding more layers in order to form a complete multifaceted, multi-genre artistic piece. Lengthened and then pausing, Virus isn’t one to play softly to the listener, it is… immense, and it won’t wait for you, fooling you through its melodic tones, but all the while putting forth this vastly enthralling, all encapsulating sound, strengthened by the hollowness of those shatteringly beautiful vocals. It is indeed a step up from the previous releases, and hopefully a positive indication of the (I won’t say immense again) things to be expecting from her.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/167732713&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29857-new-lupa-j-virus-2","category":"music","date":1411067234000,"wpid":29857,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281887219,"updatedAt":1588441754287,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d48","old_image":"generated/0045724cd2e4bf8ed0ef38c71b3dd83e255224d0.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
