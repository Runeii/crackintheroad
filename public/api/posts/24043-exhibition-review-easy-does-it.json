Coincidently a trio of shows curated by the very same guy. Coming into this during the third and final evolutionary installment, I’m so glad to have found it.</p>\n<p>The show, having travelled from the David Dale Gallery Gallery & Studios and Aid & Abet and now Supercollider, tackles the creation of complexity hidden within and being drawn out by simple actions and interventions. Questioning the very making of art in itself and the merging of the objects and artefacts we surround ourselves with. Working with what is probably largely trivial to have powerful and unexpectedly beautifully surprising works.</p>\n<p>Check out the work of Fiona Curran, who’s assemblages are now my current favourite.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/09/611.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24049\" alt=\"611\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/611-260x390.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"390\" /></a>      <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/500.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24048\" alt=\"500\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/500-260x368.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"368\" /></a></p>\n<div>While other works by Sean Edwards with minimal modernist structures, everyday objects and fabric where also pretty cool and Tom Godfrey’s “Hypotenuse”-a straightened crow bar-a piece full of comedy and intrigue. Not to mention the amazing publication that went alongside the show.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Supercollider  is a space asking new questions, taking risks in a place where art is part of an undercurrent and that has got to be a risk anyone should take.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Check out more of what’s happening at Supercollider <a href=\"https://www.supercolliderhq.org.uk/\"><strong>HERE</strong></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Or to see more from Kevin Hunt <a href=\"https://www.kevin-hunt.co.uk/\"><strong>HERE </strong></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>and Fiona Curran <a href=\"https://www.fionacurran.co.uk/\"><strong>HERE</strong></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n","slug":"24043-exhibition-review-easy-does-it","category":"arts","date":1378042695000,"wpid":24043,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283031868,"updatedAt":1587825864669,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d15","categories":["arts"]}
