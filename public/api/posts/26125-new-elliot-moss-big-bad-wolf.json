An almost Casiotone For The Painfully Alone style beat is joined by a funky bass line, and Moss’s own <strong>Thom Yorke</strong> channeling vocals. This is as smooth as it comes, and boy am I enjoying it.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/110969860&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26125-new-elliot-moss-big-bad-wolf","category":"music","date":1389981818000,"wpid":26125,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2014/01/1462960_682818078406200_576453321_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQH/8QAHxAAAQMEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQADEQIEEkEFIURy/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMEetcONtn5bJcNU41SQJ6BGtqJN5h9IUH//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282546645,"updatedAt":1588403521320,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/01/1462960_682818078406200_576453321_n.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
