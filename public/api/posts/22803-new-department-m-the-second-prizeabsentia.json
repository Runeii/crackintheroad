The other was Grammatics, and they were ruddy ace most of the time, as would you be if you were English and wrote <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCljNqQiIok\">weird rock songs</a> that sounded like Cursive’s fey and flowery little cousins.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 450px; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3025123151/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=1/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>So here’s the new double A-side from <b>Department M</b>, on which Brinley eschews guitars and flings his penchant for moody theatrics ever further into the blacklight. I was sceptical, sure – the thrusting disco rhythms of first cut <i>The Second Prize </i>vamp dangerously close to Muse territory, and no one needs that. It’s saved, though, by a number of factors, Brinley’s voice not least among ‘em, drawling out some deliciously obscure, vaguely threatening nonsense through a fug of Laudanum. It also has a number of searing, lopsided bass breaks, a clattering beat constructed partially from sounds of handguns being cocked, and ends in huge, icy sheets of synth.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 450px; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3025123151/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=2/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Really, though, the brilliance lies in <i>Absentia</i>, which pitches its keys lower and wonkier, its groove less inviting. There’s little opportunity for hip-swinging here, just bitcrushed beats and the clang of metal on metal before the whole thing explodes widescreen, goes end-credits on us with Brinley shivering <i>“I’m breathing out and breathing in”</i> like it’s all he can remind himself to do to stay conscious.</p>\n<p><i>The Second Prize/Absentia </i>is up for preorder on <a href=\"https://www.banquetrecords.com/PURE294S;jsessionid=4300580075AB4CADC4FA8742C2AAD848\">7” vinyl</a> as part of the <a href=\"https://www.toopure.com/articles/155/department-m-the-second-prize\">Too Pure Singles Club</a>.</p>\n","slug":"22803-new-department-m-the-second-prizeabsentia","category":"music","date":1372264681000,"wpid":22803,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283335095,"updatedAt":1588441764855,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273fec6ec2d10613edaa5989a64.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
