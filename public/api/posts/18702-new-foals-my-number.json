However newest track <em>My Number</em> is likely to add to anticipation building over the release of<em><strong> Holy Fire</strong></em>, their third album, which is out later next year. A return to the jagged, colourful guitars of<strong><em> Antidotes</em></strong> and off-beat percussion, it’s fairly standard Foals, but hey, if it’s not broken, why try to fix it? Check out My Number below, thanks to <a href=\"disconaivete.com\" target=\"_blank\">Disco Naiveté</a> for the heads up.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Do7V5iB6D0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18702-new-foals-my-number","category":"music","date":1355341042000,"wpid":18702,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284353077,"updatedAt":1588441772653,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/403a242ef6e450a7d4ffd8e2975ed77ad6a32146.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
