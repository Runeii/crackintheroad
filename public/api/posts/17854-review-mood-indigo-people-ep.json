{"id":"5e9c0af8774c2610387e528c","artists":["5e9b69257a1236eccfeb2344"],"title":"Review: Mood Indigo – People EP","content":"<p>Having announced his arrival on the scene with the gorgeous instrumental<em> <a href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/17042-new-mood-indigo-dive/\" target=\"_blank\">Dive</a></em>, a really vivid, <strong>Gold Panda</strong>-esque number, fusing 80’s hip-hop vibes with more modern production elements, it served as a fitting, if not slightly mystical introduction to the music of the Boston beatmaker. Now, with his debut EP,<em><strong> People</strong></em> available, it appears <strong>Mood Indigo</strong> is spreading his wings, and unveiling more of his characteristics and personality, most notably through the addition of his own vocals.</p>\n<p>Opening with the bizarrely disjointed yet wonderfully colourful <em>Bird Nest</em>, <strong><em>People EP</em></strong> is a worthwhile foray into the music of <strong>Mood Indigo</strong>, showcasing a more pop orientated side to the artist than found on <em>Dive</em>. Largely due to the inclusion of vocals, the pronounced hip-hop beats lend themselves to the usage of headphones, especially on <em>Sun Brother</em>, a delicate if not desolate track, based around the sampling of an 80’s style soul song. Personal favourite <em>Blue Spring</em> is one of the most deliciously textured pop songs you’re likely to hear this year, wrapped up nicely with a stunning set of Midi percussion. <em><strong>People</strong></em> may not quite be the debut release we expected from <strong>Mood Indigo</strong>, however it’s an intriguing composition and certainly marks the Boston musician out as a one for the future.
