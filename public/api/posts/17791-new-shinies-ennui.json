Now with the tricky first 7″ out of the way, the four piece have returned with new single<em> Ennui</em>, another four minute plus pop song, complete with shoegaze influences, singalong choruses and a cutting wit – “<em>dress me in your favourite dress, grow your hair down to your knees</em>“, everyone loves a Shiny, and it’s all to easy to hear why.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57615039\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17791-new-shinies-ennui","category":"music","date":1346761078000,"wpid":17791,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284755076,"updatedAt":1588441774831,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/74292a0155904aa148fb470cae6e6cbbad2b659f.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
