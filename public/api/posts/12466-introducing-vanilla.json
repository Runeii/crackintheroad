That’s some of the beauty in the name <strong>Vanilla</strong> – not chocolate or strawberry, but vanilla. Anonymity is a self-marketing plus for many musicians, especially in these internet-induced days, but I guess the only downer for this stuff is that it hasn’t really got out there enough. All I know about this is it’s coming from Oxford, which is encouraging, but still doesn’t give anything away. This could’ve been from anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I’m posting this ’cause <strong>Vanilla</strong> recently graced us with this beatific new production, simply entitled <em>Else</em>, with an intensely nostalgic R’n’B sound to it. Unlike the soulful beats of their previous <em>High Life</em> release, this one sounds almost <strong>Com Truise</strong>-like, bordering on chillwave, if you can still call it that. It has a very different texture to it, almost fizzy – but the light, steady beat thankfully grounds it.</p>\n<p>The usual <strong>Dilla</strong> comparisons are there, when analysing the aforementioned <em>High Life</em> album, but I’d sooner compare it to someone like <strong>J Rocc</strong>, given the soul samples, or more recent players like <strong>Knxwledge</strong> and <strong>Star Slinger</strong>. I guess the <strong>Dilla</strong> comparisons come from how optimistic (as well as clean-cut) this stuff sounds, which must only be a good thing. I hope either of these keep you going over the next couple of months – they’ll definitely do me nicely.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Else and High Life below.</em></p>\n<p><center><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25231137&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25231137&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></center><center></center><center></center></p>\n<p><center><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1590817222/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=000000/transparent=true/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://vanillabeats.bandcamp.com/album/high-life\">High Life by Vanilla</a></iframe></center></p>\n","slug":"12466-introducing-vanilla","category":"introducing","date":1320964984000,"wpid":12466,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/11/vanilla-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAYHCP/EACMQAAIBAgQHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDAgAEBQYREgcTIUFRYZH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBP/EABsRAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgQFERJR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBNTw+uGK3BMiNPFCyyM4SI5R+VqnLSVSwhxkuBO3vEVM7trBduAnIATl0191HG4tvGozo10//Z"},"createdAt":1587293507095,"updatedAt":1588443777553,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/11/vanilla-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
