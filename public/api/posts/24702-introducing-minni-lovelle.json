Squeezing in somewhere between the elegant, soulful wanderings of<strong> London Grammar</strong>, and more single orientated chart success stories (or future success stories aka Vaults). Of the three tracks, <em>Holes In My Suitcase</em> showcases Turan’s sultry, on point vocals, layered over a sparse, glitchy beat, whereas lead single <em>What I Knew</em> is a straight up, no strings attached pop number, destined to be remixed hundreds of times for dancefloors around the UK. She may have seemingly sprung from nowhere, but Minni Lovelle is a name you’re going to want to remember.</p>\n<p>Check out What I Knew and Holes In My Suitcase below, as well as the full EP under that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/110610547\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/110594523\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/10462746\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24702-introducing-minni-lovelle","category":"introducing","date":1382476940000,"wpid":24702,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282847396,"updatedAt":1588441761510,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/10/minni-lovelle-press-1a-950x633.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
