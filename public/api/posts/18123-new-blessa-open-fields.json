While the lovely folk of <strong>LBH </strong>have plied their trade for longer and honed their sound with more clarity, there is a pulsating core of potential in ‘Open Fields’ that can be heard in the confidently controlled changes in tempo, along with the backdrop of echoing guitars and loose percussion.</p>\n<p>There is an undeniable listenability to ‘Open Fields’, and I look forward to hearing the next demo to make it’s way out of <strong>Blessa </strong>HQ.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F63908292&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18123-new-blessa-open-fields","category":"introducing","date":1350662789000,"wpid":18123,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":400,"height":399,"src":"2012/10/bless-open-fields.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgUH/8QAIRAAAgECBgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABEEBRIiUZEVUnH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBv/EABoRAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAQIEEiH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJ3lsPIdro5N9Nj3ajBm0ywxhsUtwoB2Dj7Wco7gghmB0c09bex7o26UEZFkz//Z"},"createdAt":1587284598531,"updatedAt":1588403535736,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2012/10/bless-open-fields.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
