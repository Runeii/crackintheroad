A reworking of a <strong>Young Minds</strong> <a href=\"https://orca-orca.bandcamp.com/track/underground\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a> from 2010, it benefits from cleaner production making it sound less twee and more ready for live performances. There’s touches of <strong>Mumm-ra</strong>, <strong>The Drums</strong> and <strong>Death Cab For Cutie</strong> on <em>Underground</em>, all combining to form two and a half minutes of idyllic, indie-pop; well worthy of a listen. <em>Underground</em> will form part of <strong>Orca Orca’s</strong> next release entitled <em><strong>Make Live</strong></em>, a limited edition cassette run featuring six new recordings and hand-painted artwork which drops 21 February.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F34196463\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F34196463\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/orcaorca-1/underground\">Underground</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/orcaorca-1\">orca orca</a></span></p>\n","slug":"14357-new-mpfree-orca-orca-underground","category":"mpfree","date":1327276595000,"wpid":14357,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293025368,"updatedAt":1588441783233,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/921ce3a56c4225c870f982973c39a34d2c8d0dfc.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
