Continuing in their aggressive style that gained <em><strong>Ex-military</strong></em>, their debut LP so much attention, there’s a slightly more refined edge to both tracks, perhaps readying the group for more mainstream success. <em>Get Got</em> is a repetitive, almost trance inspired track, with the heavy synths dominating throughout and far more immediate than the other new cut. <em>Blackjack </em>appears slightly weaker, focusing on sampled lyrical sections and dark, brooding synth sections. Above all, they’re intense, raw and exhilarating; everything we love from them.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear as to whether these tracks will appear on their forthcoming releases. Check them both out below, as well as the video to go with <em>Get Got</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F37833046&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F37831812&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIrKSqb4H4A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15332-new-death-grips-get-got-blackjack","category":"mpfree","date":1330352768000,"wpid":15332,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292754460,"updatedAt":1588441780726,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/02/screen-shot-2011-08-08-at-13.28.34-165x123.png","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
