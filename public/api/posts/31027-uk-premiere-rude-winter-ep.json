{"id":"5e9bfee7774c2610387e438c","artists":["5e9b693e7a1236eccfeb24b9"],"title":"UK Premiere: Rude – Winter EP","content":"<p>Having made a name for himself at the start of this year with Heartbreaker, the follow up to his infectious debut demo, Disco, anonymous singer / producer / band (?) <strong>Rude</strong> has shared the most intimate side to the project yet, in the form of an EP featuring three brand new tracks.</p><p>Certainly not the only musician choosing to keep information scarce, Rude has perhaps kept his / their cards closer to his chest than anyone else, even keeping images and artwork to the utmost minimal. One clue could perhaps be his ties to new collective, Love By Mistake, which also counts IYES and Deaths on their roster, although whether there’s anything more to that, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>Opening with the frenetic, early 00’s pop sounding <em>Heartbreaker</em>, it quickly slips into more reserved territory on EP highlight <em>Sapphire</em>, undeniably one of this years gems. <em>Icecold</em> chooses to lay the vocals against a more R&B inspired backdrop, not too far from the emotional tug that James Blake’s sophomore album called upon, before the EP closes out with a plea to a current lover, in the form of <em>Outro / Farewell</em>. All in all, it’s an EP that not only showcases a great deal of potential, but also allows much to be savoured in the moment.
