With an abundance of synth-pop duo’s filling up the pages on all the slickest blogs at the moment, <strong>Love Echo</strong> are serious contenders to leave the realms of the internet and blossom into the daunting, commercial abyss in which we all thrive.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F72775997\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19072-new-love-echo-daybreak","category":"music","date":1357856440000,"wpid":19072,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":628,"src":"2013/01/575218_239043646207955_1447647138_n-950x628.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIhAAAQQABQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABAwQFBhETIRIxQXGh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABf/EABoRAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECABEDMfD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANrzvatVYcEsRzPsHYECjFtOoSHR2fnx39qbZjqHYlLabknf6iIp1tzF8BpAe3P/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284199233,"updatedAt":1588443770714,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/01/575218_239043646207955_1447647138_n-950x628.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
