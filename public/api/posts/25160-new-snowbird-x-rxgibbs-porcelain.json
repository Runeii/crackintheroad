They’ve introduced themselves to the world through <em>Porcelain</em>, a quiet and tentative number which sees Dosen’s voice float over pianos and orchestral sounds. This remix by RxGibbs completely changes the ambience of the track. By layering vocals, beats, and echoes of the pianos and strings from the original, the remix expands into a world of sound, incorporating shoe-gaze, dub and folk. Pretty beautiful if you ask me.</p>\n<p>Their debut album, <em><strong>Moo</strong></em>n, is due for an early 2014 release.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/121831555″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"25160-new-snowbird-x-rxgibbs-porcelain","category":"music","date":1386171692000,"wpid":25160,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":848,"src":"2013/12/snowbird-950x848.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAJAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwEH/8QAHxAAAgICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEQMhMTJBYXGB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDd8zsiArhZ9diBUK73RHiVuE+wW6j7grIF/9k="},"createdAt":1587282719008,"updatedAt":1588443765753,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0c","old_image":"2013/12/snowbird-950x848.jpg","categories":["music","remixes","newnews"]}
