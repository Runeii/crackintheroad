The next track from the LP is <em>Anomaly</em>, a title that <strong>Airick Woodhead</strong> perhaps saw as a statement of intent for the tracks’ blueprint. Listening to the track is as much about arranging the sonic styles and choices yourself, than it is about enjoying them. Sudden choppy and abrupt drumming fills, souring and slightly ugly synth build-ups and clashing pitch shifted vocals are used as seen as paint strokes, all intelligently built up to form something that sounds genuinely original.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74272838\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19135-new-doldrums-anomaly","category":"music","date":1358276711000,"wpid":19135,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":839,"src":"2013/01/lesserevil-950x839.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAJAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQQH/8QAJhAAAQIEAwkAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFEQcSYRQ1NkFRc3Sxs//EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Akr+DdGqdWvJrWhTrhW44wrMHCVWOXQc+hh5vASnNNpb28jIAmxbva2sIS/CE15Mx9VRh9R3hNd1Xsw1IoB21xH//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284176817,"updatedAt":1588443770633,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/01/lesserevil-950x839.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
