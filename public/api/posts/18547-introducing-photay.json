From the upbeat opener <em>Nostalgic Flavours</em> to the ambient closer <em>The Return Home</em>, it’s an unrelenting listen, both in your face and somehow detracted from the listener, dwelling in its own unique consciousness.</p>\n<p>The aspect that particularly stands out is the engaging and unpredictable percussion, allowing the rest of the instrumentation to become ever more intoxicating. Throwing in samples from films, other songs and TV shows, it finds itself somewhere between Battles and The Avalanches in it’s complex yet thoroughly rewarding makeup. Check out the full release below, and tell your brother about Photay before everyone is talking about him.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3873608345/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18547-introducing-photay","category":"introducing","date":1354545805000,"wpid":18547,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284419284,"updatedAt":1588441773243,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/5dfd78819588a02c75edc1d1edb36543f6156aec.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
