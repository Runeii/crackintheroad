His latest track, ‘Spin’, is a truly beautiful and utterly composed effort that is destined to be adored by an ever growing audience. Finding it’s strength in it’s seeming simplicity, Eaves has created a track that would sink into the heart of even the most stoic individual.</p>\n<p>Performing next week at St Stephen’s Church in London, in support of Vance Joy, Eaves is an artist you must see live.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/122288533\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25042-new-eaves-spin","category":"music","date":1385723953000,"wpid":25042,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/11/eaves.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGB//EACEQAQABAwQCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMRBBIhIhUxMkGR/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABf/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAP/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMnt29OluRGLYJCbgJXQwcAY5RxTI1egthDxF/r1+MPqordKLIJIZfTRG0eUPykr5FBj5tF3/9k="},"createdAt":1587282743364,"updatedAt":1588403524666,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2013/11/eaves.jpg","categories":["music","newnews"]}
