Ranging from the drone inspired <em>Our Fate Is In Our Hands</em> to the shoegaze drawl of <em>Dreams Two [Perfume – Dream Fighter__Richard Pinhas – Sur Le Theme De Bene Gesserit II]</em>, the sonic variation is quite unlike any other vocal-less record I’ve experienced before.</p>\n<p><em>Junker [Clio – Eyes]</em> is a more jazz, tripped out number showcasing the ethereal element to <strong>Shattered Holograms</strong> music, even chucking in a few samples on <em>Clear Blue Skies // Far Away My Mind [Carrara – Driving]</em>. All in all, it’s a record that is impossibly difficult to summarize, purely for it’s eloquence, power and diversity.
