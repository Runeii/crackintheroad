So<strong> Prom</strong> are still very much learning their trade, however on Spring Training there’s an underlying true passion behind what they do, and whilst it may be a while before they’re noticed by a larger audience, you can almost guarantee it will happen at some point in the future.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 593px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4271514438/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24178-new-prom-spring-training","category":"mpfree","date":1378757908000,"wpid":24178,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2013/09/a1406502963_10-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgUH/8QAIxAAAgAFBAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwUREgQGITIVIkFhcf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAGREBAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAzER/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAgmi3Eak1VlTpWpnh3WcZbDJJY6Fvrg2te0RTvGpkktqWy+fYiEW3mPhqs9zlgwvfnrGZv3b9iYkr0TmO1ZkR7n//Z"},"createdAt":1587283006238,"updatedAt":1588443767189,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/09/a1406502963_10-165x165.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
