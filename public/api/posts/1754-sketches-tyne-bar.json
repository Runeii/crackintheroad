With the legendary <strong>Cooperage</strong> closing all those months ago many found themselves isolated, frustrated and alone; or perhaps that was just me (I fucking loved that place).</p>\n<p>Hyperbole aside, a little part of Newcastle’s culture died that day. However what emerged from the now reopening <strong>Cooperage’s</strong> ashes was a multitude of stable club nights, that although more central retained the pulse that made the <strong>Cooperage</strong> so exciting. <strong>OCTA PUSH’s</strong> appearance at the  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/thetynebar?ref=ts\"><strong>Tyne Bar</strong></a> last weekend was a great example of this, a whirlwind of sounds created quite simply by word of mouth and buzz, two things that Newcastle’s scene was once built on.</p>\n<p>So a week later, what’s to look forward to? Well tomorrow (9th of July), sees the lads from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/pages/SKETCHES/115221568513232?ref=ts\"><strong>Sketches</strong></a> emerge from the dim neon of Newcastle’s <strong>North Bar</strong>. Playing anything from shoe-gaze to dubstep, the night seems guaranteed to jar, contort and make very little sense, but why would you want anything else? So all that’s left to be done is to urge you get down to the <strong>Tyne Bar</strong> from 8pm tomorrow, you may even enjoy yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/event.php?eid=110846845630888&ref=ts\">Check out the Facebook Event</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/pages/SKETCHES/115221568513232?ref=ts\">‘Like’ Sketches on Facebook</a></p>\n","slug":"1754-sketches-tyne-bar","category":"life","date":1278623894000,"wpid":1754,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":398,"src":"2010/07/sketches.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIRAAAQMDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEgYRITEiQYH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A1bRMqBbLpJ0tAmLS9FbMxcchYCG3OSoKOWR36GXv5VSNqCyvRmnU3VBStAUMoq9+Rvz490pUzKP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587295135246,"updatedAt":1588403565789,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2010/07/sketches.jpg","categories":["life","music"]}
