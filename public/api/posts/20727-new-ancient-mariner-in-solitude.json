{"id":"5e9c06e2774c2610387e4f0c","artists":["5e9b68c77a1236eccfeb1daa"],"title":"New: Ancient Mariner – In Solitude","content":"<p>Photo: Luca Venter</p>\n<p>Since impressing with his debut track <a href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/20254-new-ancient-mariner-acedia/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Acedia</em></a> earlier in the year, Denver’s <strong>Ancient Mariner</strong> aka Gabriel Jorgensen has been putting the finishing touches to his soon to be released EP. The title track,<em> In Solitude</em>, made available late last night, is a more delicate number, yet equally as enchanting. Possessing a real narrative, it’s a breath of fresh air amongst the growing sphere of dreamy, indie pop acts, of whom many appear too keen to simply drift along, as oppose to pushing the boundaries of their sound. From the ethereal crescendo’s to the minimal lulls, Ancient Mariner manipulates the silence as much as he does the grand instrumental sections. Check out <em>In Solitude</em> below, and keep it locked for his debut EP of the same title, out soon.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F80829720\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20727-new-ancient-mariner-in-solitude","category":"music","date":1364913956000,"wpid":20727,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283682965,"updatedAt":1588441767481,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273a04a65297da832411c3ba56d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
