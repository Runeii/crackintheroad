Her debut offering, Forgetful is a glorious slice of R&B influenced psychedelia; all underpinned by a funky, real 80’s sounding beat. With more tracks expected over the coming months, you can bet that 2016 is shaping up rather well for <strong>Thandi</strong>. Check out Forgetful below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/254708844&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"32052-premiere-thandi-forgetful","category":"music","date":1458799285000,"wpid":32052,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1200,"height":800,"src":"2016/03/12493530_1668994233377459_7836172426726658635_o-1200x800.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHRAAAQQDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBAUDEWEHEv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCEoJddV+YUtLKh48huo9hLzZtbLSB8t11oYCD0rEdBEQf/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587280190544,"updatedAt":1588403507657,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2016/03/12493530_1668994233377459_7836172426726658635_o-1200x800.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
