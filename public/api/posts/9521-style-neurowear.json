{"id":"5e9c2fbc9b6559241525da26","title":"Style: Neurowear","content":"<p><strong>Neurowear</strong> is just one of those items, that’s so baffling, so obscure and so seemingly pointless; you simply have to know more.</p><p> A Japanese company has developed the product; electromechanical cat ears that are worn almost like a hair band on the human head. The ears can then be moved and manipulated with only the human mind.</p>\n<p>As well as being striking, (I mean this in the most un-pretentious way possible), they also, rather surprisingly, display a variety of emotions. They stand erect when a user is concentrating, wriggle when amused or excited and lay flat when bored or passive. Well, perhaps not a variety, but there’s more than one, I’ll give them that.</p>\n<p>There also seems to be a slightly more serious benefit to the headwear. <strong>Neurowear</strong> have already stated that the ears would be perfect as a means of expression for a user with communication difficulties. A valiant sentiment, but it’s hard to imagine this was the first thing on the scientists’ minds after taking a look at their press shots.  Still, not complaining.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w06zvM2x_lw\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"9521-style-neurowear","category":"life","date":1312374006000,"wpid":9521,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/neurowear-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMFCP/EACQQAAEDAgYCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQABQYREiEjMRNRFEJx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAbEQACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAEERIUMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AvYkvECxSIzVwCm2XyEebbShR61egd96atMZK1BTrIIORGsUGKIcaTcj8mOy9ygciAroDLv8ATWdZ8h4TpADzgAcV9j7NVusrEEXg1IuKsD2f/9k="},"createdAt":1587294140479,"updatedAt":1588403551636,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/08/neurowear-165x165.jpg","categories":["life"]}
