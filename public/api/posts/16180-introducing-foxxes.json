This debut collection of tracks released under the title <em><strong>Otocyon</strong></em> EP just scream potential, with their ever-so-disjointed feel and slightly lethargic atmosphere.</p>\n<p>There’s moments when<strong> Foxxes</strong> appears overly rigid and reliant on the same repetitive loops, yet when he choose to experiment and push the boat out further (<em>Ongaku</em>) it pays dividends. It’s modern instrumental hip-hop at it’s utmost youthful and intoxicating, conjuring up a mystical and at times enchanting vibe. Although it’s still early days, this debut EP puts <strong>Foxxes</strong> up there with the likes of <strong>Beat Culture</strong> and<strong> xxyyxx</strong> as a real name to watch out for in the future.
