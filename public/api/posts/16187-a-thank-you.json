As readers have turned into writers, and writers into friends, we cannot express just how thankful we are for people taking the time to read, to listen and to think; three vices that cannot be overestimated, especially in a world increasingly filled with animosity and dissatisfaction. Thank you, and may the next two years be equally as enjoyable.</p>\n","slug":"16187-a-thank-you","category":"editorials","date":1335888924000,"wpid":16187,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":640,"height":427,"src":"2012/05/5182219236_ddfa9b8459_z.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQSMRFBBQYy/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQX/xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AoPGe2S0q9l9YmNssWBiA+TgBkOu9LIbtuN92w55c9xkcS7jZ52iKirHPOteE/9k="},"createdAt":1587290582818,"updatedAt":1588403539735,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/05/5182219236_ddfa9b8459_z.jpg","categories":["editorials"]}
