The interjection of raspy vocals only furthers this mystery as the track begins to climax in to a crescendo of layered guitars and cries of vocals that ultimately create a track that is more an expression of emotion, in contrast to the structured narrative of ‘Your Sun Will Explode’. An equally talented AA side, ‘Your Sun Will Explode’ reveals the raw attitude of the band’s sound, with the opening lyrics of ‘I will jump from the top/I am everything you’re not/Well you question the roots that made us strong’ demonstrating a powerful level of dark intensity. Periods of melancholy are robustly countered by periods of passion, fueled by emotional hurt, and vice versa, until the track fades away into a finale of contemplative exhaustion.</p>\n<p>A fantastic debut single, and all you have to do is press play below to hear it!</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"136\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F515976\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"136\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F515976\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/theprisonlibrary/sets/vol-1\">Vol.1</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/theprisonlibrary\">theprisonlibrary</a></span></p>\n","slug":"4880-single-of-the-week-the-prison-library-out-of-sightyour-sun-will-explode","category":"music","date":1300122208000,"wpid":4880,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294662768,"updatedAt":1588441789990,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2737db8091889a4f10bc9a94513.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
