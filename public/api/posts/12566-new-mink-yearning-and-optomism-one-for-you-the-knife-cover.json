Opening with a cover of <strong>The Knife’s</strong> psychedelic track <em>One For You</em>, and morphing it into a gorgeously minimal vocal driven gem, it’s clear from the off that <strong>Mink</strong> has talent.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4266136718/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Second track <em>Yearning and Optomism</em> is less atmospheric, and follows a fairly standard electronic structure, but pulls if off elegantly, with the swirling layered vocals proving a particular highlight. As with much of the new music on <em><strong>CitR</strong></em>, I’m yet to find out too much about this Seattle artist, but I’m extremely excited to hear more from her.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3435435398/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12566-new-mink-yearning-and-optomism-one-for-you-the-knife-cover","category":"introducing","date":1321348920000,"wpid":12566,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293474808,"updatedAt":1588441786410,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/adb7f8e165749565763b55757b686b71cc4a7bd5.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
