Lambert’s EP ‘Letter’s Don’t Talk’ gives an insight into the beautiful and absorbing nature of her performance, demonstrating very strong vocals and a keen observance of engaging and galvanizing instrumentation, surrounding what are very personal, and raw, themes and emotions.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=534261652/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"20422-introducing-mary-lambert","category":"introducing","date":1363534243000,"wpid":20422,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283765463,"updatedAt":1588441768368,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/32e198e8c1376c689b3b204260f555c7bca92c8c.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
