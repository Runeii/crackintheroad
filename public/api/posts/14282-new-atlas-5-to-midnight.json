From there, you can find their <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/atlasmsc\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>, which reveals <strong>ATLAS</strong> as the project of a certain <strong>Sarah Hezen</strong> from London. Anyway, enough detective work, new cut <em>5 To Midnight</em> is a slightly less refined affair, seemingly rougher round the edges. There’s the delicate female vocals and dubstep inspired beats, rolling gloriously throughout the track in a menacing fashion yet it’s reassuringly realistic. Despite only having two tracks out so far, <strong>ATLAS</strong> is quickly becoming one of my favourite new artists, check out <em>5 To Midnight</em> below.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33609628\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33609628\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/atlasmsc/5-to-midnight\">5 to Midnight</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/atlasmsc\">ATLAS Music</a></span></p>\n","slug":"14282-new-atlas-5-to-midnight","category":"music","date":1326914324000,"wpid":14282,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293050085,"updatedAt":1588441783445,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/b6229f7dd34d34819c92f6d907dfaff59114e5b4.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
