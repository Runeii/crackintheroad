You can check out this year’s line-up over at <a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/#bbc_introducing\">Glastonbury’s site</a>.</p>\n<p>I think <a title=\"BBC Glastonbury - New Music\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010j8y5/profiles/festivals\">BBC Introducing</a> actually quite a cool idea and invaluable for bands trying to get their name out there. Taking advantage of the BBC’s vast network of local radio stations, regional experts filter and recommend tracks they deem worthy of national attention.  Since 2009 artists have also been able to upload their tracks via the<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/introducing/uploader/\"> BBC Introducing site</a>.</p>\n<p>As well as giving previously undiscovered artists airtime, the BBC then hosts these bands on stages at a ton of festivals across the country including Glastonbury, Leeds & Reading, Radio 1’s Big Weekend and T in the Park.</p>\n<p>This line-up announcement follows the <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2013/05/30/bbc-promise-first-truly-digital-glastonbury/\">news last month</a> that more than 120 live performances will be filmed and broadcast exclusively by the BBC.</p>\n<p>Michael Eavis, Glastonbury festival founder said: “The BBC have stuck with us through thick and thin since 1997 and they’ve earned their stripes the hard way.”</p>\n<p>“It’s been quite a journey since ’97 and to have a complete record of what we’ve been up to over the years is music history gold dust.”</p>\n<p><em>*Yeah that’s right, you heard her here first.</em></p>\n","slug":"22677-news-glastonbury-announces-bbc-introducing-2013-line-up","category":"festivals","date":1371806191000,"wpid":22677,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283361642,"updatedAt":1588441765099,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d40","old_image":"generated/ad76e6dae42390cdd2f9b88cbb22aafd7db6f0e5.jpg","categories":["festivals","news","music"]}
