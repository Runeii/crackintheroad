As <a href=\"https://www.miasmah.com/recordings/cat.html#MIACD016\">Miasmah</a> records state in their own press release, it would be very easy to pass of the LP as soundtrack music and little else, but there’s a whole multi-faceted plot current that’s explored, with little need for visual aids. It’s confident in sonic expression.</p>\n<p>It’s varied as well, always keeping the listener on their toes, taking influences from opera and yes, musical scores, it manages transports in a way that is just as exciting as it is ambitious.
