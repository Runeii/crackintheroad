It’s not the cliches of waking up alone that hit hardest; it’s simply the continuation of life, knowing that you’re both going on without each other. So it makes it all the more refreshing to hear <strong>Ashley Koett’s</strong> latest single, which digs deep into the anguish of losing someone you really care about, specifically seeing them with another. <em>Lover</em> hits hard lyrically, relying on Koett’s exquisitely unique vocal – making lines like ‘<em>everything is real / that you’re not here / that you don’t love me</em>‘ get even further under the skin.
