Looking back, the piece with thin in its references and lacked a cutting blow to our friend Tyler. Yet my point still stands, as a group of music lovers, I don’t think we challenged Tyler about his abusive and bigoted vocabulary enough.</p>\n<p>A year goes by and we have a new Prince of Hip-Hop, <strong><a title=\"New: A$AP Rocky – Celebration\" href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13848-new-aap-rocky-celebration/\">A$AP Rocky</a></strong>, and it seems a remarkable change in doctrine to go with it. Below is a transcription of an interview he did with <a href=\"https://www.spinner.com/2012/02/17/asap-rocky-hip-hop-homophobia/\"><strong>Spinner</strong></a> and his attitude to homophobia within hip-hop.</p>\n<p>It’s an exciting attitude to hear from the new generation of Hip-Hop, but with cats like <strong>Tyler the Creator</strong> still as popular as ever, is it enough?</p>\n<address><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">“I don’t give a f— about your business.

If you’re straight, we can be friends…I really don’t give a fuck and I don’t think anyone should care about what another man’s preference is…As long as you’re a great person and, y’know, you don’t bother me and make me uncomfortable, then let’s be friends, dude.</span></address>\n<address> </address>\n<address><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[Hip-hop] needs to stop being so close-minded because that will just cause the genre to fail. Look at pop. Pop doesn’t discriminate against people. Look at Lady Gaga, y’know what I mean? Who the fuck makes the rules for hip-hop? Who the fuck dictates who’s cool and who’s not?”</span></address>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33418326&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15162-news-aap-rocky-talks-homophopia-in-hip-hop","category":"music","date":1329601467000,"wpid":15162,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292800218,"updatedAt":1588441781204,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/cce607c4d975ae49d68b484eaef51a6413fa73b1.jpg","categories":["music","news"]}
