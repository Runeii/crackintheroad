From putting make-up on and downing a bottle of vodka, to lucid moments in a packed club, <em>Fever</em> is a thought-provoking look at the stereotypical adolescent lifestyle. Yet for all it’s cliches and intentional controversy (numerous scenes of drug use), it leaves the viewer with a sense of ambiguity and cautious intrigue, as it closes with the girl holding a letter that simply states ‘Follow Your Dream’. <em>Fever</em> is released through <strong>RAMP Recordings</strong> on 7/11/11, check out the video below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tRf9SkTGsI\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12049-video-stay-fever","category":"music","date":1319552801000,"wpid":12049,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293635523,"updatedAt":1588441787719,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/0768370c4f317337b92f4cbfe36373663deb02ab.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
