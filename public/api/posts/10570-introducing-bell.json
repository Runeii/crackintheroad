It was so long in fact, that her debut LP, <em><strong>Diamonite</strong></em>, completely passed me by. So three months after the record’s release, I feel it’s time to regroup and discuss.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Diamonite</strong></em> isn’t so much of a reinvention as it is a reimagining of the piano based sounds we heard on the first record. Despite the new direction, the sweet sounds of <strong>Olga Bell</strong>’s voice are as omnipresent as ever, combining the otherworldly aspects of <strong>Bjork</strong>’s persona with <strong>Regina Spektor</strong> like observations. It’s an engrossing combination of vocal styles, yet still utterly <strong>BELL</strong>.</p>\n<p>What perhaps stands out above all else is the energy that serves as a backdrop to <strong>Bell</strong>’s vocals. Voice recordings clash and contort, at times forming incomprehensible walls of vocals. The beats jerk and scatter as if on a mission of their own, the different dimensions of the music in a sense feel at odds with each other; but wonderfully so. <strong>BELL</strong> have an amazing ability to make music that assumes a confrontational position, while sucking the listener in emotionally. They make music that sounds like it could have been made by a small army, but a human army could have made it nonetheless.</p>\n<p>With live shows as well as a handful of rather brave live covers under their belt, <strong>BELL</strong> could very well become a band that are increasingly on music lovers’ radars. Here’s hoping, because they fucking deserve to be.</p>\n<p>Stream the album as well as some interesting covers below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1622864793/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"150\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F21751959\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F21751959\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad/bell-videotape-the-eraser\">BELL-Videotape/The Eraser</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad\">crackintheroad</a></span></p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F21269155\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F21269155\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bellinspace/bell-aaliyah-cover\">BELL – Aaliyah Cover</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bellinspace\">B E L L</a></span></p>\n","slug":"10570-introducing-bell","category":"music","date":1314142397000,"wpid":10570,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/bell-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587293994314,"updatedAt":1588403549745,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/08/bell-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
