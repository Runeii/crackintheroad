Predominantly using <strong>The Weeknd’s</strong> vocals, <strong>Shlohmo’s</strong> remix has a more atmospheric, spacious feel to it, extremely suited to being played at the hippest clubs in the slickest cities.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36408430&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14905-new-drake-featuring-the-weeknd-crew-love-shlohmo-remix","category":"mpfree","date":1329091226000,"wpid":14905,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292862247,"updatedAt":1588441781951,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/dd18c6d5e5631e4179f5154b44bbb2aa80348302.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
