A grander musical arena that if anything coincided with a record that was as difficult, if not more so, than his past material. Focusing almost entirely on looped sounds, <strong>Stott</strong> delicately manipulates vocals and ‘found sound’ to ultimate exploitation. It’s the music of a paranoid and obsessive character. So perhaps It’s with half a degree fun and another half arrogance that anonymous producer <strong><a href=\"https://recycleculture.tumblr.com/\">Recycle Culture</a></strong> has reworked <strong>Stotts</strong> album track, <em>Leaving</em>, into a barf inducing trance tune. Let’s just say it almost, almost, works, and leave it at that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F70210452?\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"18624-andy-stott-leaving-the-recycle-culture-uplift","category":"music","date":1354803564000,"wpid":18624,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284392181,"updatedAt":1588441772975,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/07c76d225bf121433c54bf1179937c37d55dce0e.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
