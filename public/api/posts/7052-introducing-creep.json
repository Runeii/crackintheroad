This was largely down to the complete lack of material online. After watching them live last night however I was compelled to write about them regardless. The set was full of elegantly eerie visuals and a confident mixture of styles. Mixing elements of dubstep and witchhaus, <strong>CREEP</strong> on paper sound like a lot of bands doing the rounds at present, but it’s their attempt to embrace a more ambitious, orchestral like sound that’s making them stand out. This was even more evident when played live, they came complete with a superb cello player, who effortlessly gave the sound a clarity that no lo-fi spooky ass shit can come close to. Expect a full review of the show tomorrow.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F7836850\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F7836850\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/youngturks/creep-days\">CREEP / Days</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/youngturks\">Young Turks</a></span> </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v4oeLsTh5dQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"7052-introducing-creep","category":"music","date":1304033463000,"wpid":7052,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":588,"src":"2011/04/creep.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQI/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABRIhQlFx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Az/AeRMkwnZ2vQ8Y63JMsoXwU+jo0T40Aar3kUjVIEh0NyiUBR4ktV1f3GMFVykN//9k="},"createdAt":1587294459088,"updatedAt":1588403556460,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/04/creep.jpg","categories":["music"]}
