It was one of those tracks that made you sit back and say, <em>“fuck, this is just….great”</em>. It didn’t necessarily get me in a tizz the first time around, but the more and more I listened, the more I <em>kept</em> on listening. It is what it is; timeless, uncomplicated, one of those tracks that makes you appreciate good old-fashioned song writing more than ever.</p>\n<p>Their follow up to the <a href=\"https://italianbeachbabes.bigcartel.com/\">Italian Beach Babes</a> release doesn’t have ‘SINGLE’ written all over it like <em>‘Ritual Confessions</em>’ did. Regardless, it’s mellow and heartfelt and sports a much more cavernous sound, thanks mostly to some wonderful harmonies.</p>\n<p>Stream the track below.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27476588\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27476588\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"12375-new-fear-of-men-doldrums","category":"music","date":1320808838000,"wpid":12375,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293531298,"updatedAt":1588441787020,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/82e74e129e5712f3a3d1054399ddcc703ebaea7a.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
