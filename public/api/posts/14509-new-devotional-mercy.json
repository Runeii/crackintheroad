However, all that is forgiven once you hear the track in question, a luxuriously elegant female vocal led number, sort of <strong>Keep Shelly In Athens</strong> meets <strong>Massive Attack</strong>, using it’s electronic influences to fantastic effect. When lead singer Madelaine Lucas weeps <em>“have a mercy on me”</em> around the three minute mark, it would take an extremely cold, emotionally devoid person to not feel something.
