{"id":"5e9c32b09b6559241525df38","artists":["5e9b68da7a1236eccfeb1e9d"],"title":"Review: British Sea Power – Living Is So Easy","content":"<img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://lazybrighton.</p><p>co.uk/uploads/2010/01/bsp.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" />\n<p>Having recently announced <em>Valhalla Dancehall</em> as the title for their forthcoming album,<strong> British Sea Power</strong> have generously decided to give away a track from the record, released at the beginning of next year. <em>Living Is So Easy</em> is available to download from the groups <a href=\"https://www.britishseapower.co.uk/\">Official Site</a>, in exchange for your email address. Much is expected of the Brighton based group, after their most commercially successful album to date, the Mercury Nominated <em>Do You Like Rock Music?.</em></p>\n<p><em>Living Is So Easy </em>picks up in a similar jovial, folk pop style, it’s almost like an electronically orientated <strong>Mumford & Sons</strong>, which isn’t anywhere near as horrendous as it sounds. It’s simple yet effective,<strong> Yan’s </strong>vocals are delivered in his traditional laid-back style, backed up by female vocals from new<strong> British Sea Power </strong>member <strong>Abi Fry</strong>. When we caught up with the guys, they told us how they forced themselves into isolation for the recording of <em>Valhalla Dancehall</em>, and the effect of this has seemingly inspired them to produce a more refined sound, although the lyrics at times contain a monumental bleakness only they could master. It’s a welcome return from the guys, and this track is sure to expand their ever growing fan base in the run up to the release of their new record.</p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_11244048.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"3516-review-british-sea-power-living-is-so-easy","category":"music","date":1290109061000,"wpid":3516,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":333,"src":"2011/06/bsp.jpeg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIBAAAQMEAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFERIhMUEGE//EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARES/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDNrd9Wwq1CK3EckXh2TpGH6aoba1GQrbg7HwY6zUrIviy+4SwkEqPCVrA78GaUoWUIrP/Z"},"createdAt":1587294896573,"updatedAt":1588403562582,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/bsp.jpeg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
