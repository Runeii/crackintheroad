NY’s Wayne Memmer aka <strong>No Valley</strong> joined by Jason Sarubbi and<br />\nNikolai Middlebrook may well have written one of the most ‘fun’ tracks of the year. <em>Charlie Don’t Surf</em> is raucous, light-hearted rock and roll at it’s best, avoiding the turgid stonk of The Vaccines and drawing ever so slightly from the 80’s influences that The Drums attempt to copy.
