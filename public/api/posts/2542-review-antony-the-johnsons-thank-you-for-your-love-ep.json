Acting as a tantalising taster of the upcoming album<em> Swanlights</em>, this collection of tracks bodes very well for the future release. Just like last years release,<strong> Antony’s</strong> voice is as angelic and uplifting as ever, with title track<em> Thank You For You Love</em> being a simple yet stunning piano led composition, building to an all out trumpet blaring epic anthem.<strong> Antony</strong> also takes on the task of covering songs by two of the greats, <em>Imagine</em> by<strong> John Lennon</strong> and<em> Pressing On</em> by <strong>Bob Dylan</strong> respectively. Pressing On is fairly non-distinct, however<em> Imagine</em> is an ambitious and alluring version of what is widely regarded as one of the greatest songs of all time. Taking the song into a first person perspective,<strong> Antony’s</strong> voice controls each word delicately, caressing and elegantly massaging every syllable. Not since<strong> John Lennon </strong>has it sounded so chillingly appropriate for a singer to morosely yearn “<em>they say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one</em>“.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/antonyandthejohnsons/\">Check Out Antony & The Johnson’s Myspace!</a></p>\n<p><script src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_12532721.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n","slug":"2542-review-antony-the-johnsons-thank-you-for-your-love-ep","category":"music","date":1281967443000,"wpid":2542,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":337,"src":"2011/06/l_756ce052626d4706a2d8aa7ed6abc5af.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIhAAAgEDBAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCAAQSBQYREwchIkFh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMh3B5FVuCwZZ3ab5Za0gDsW2CUjHrUvKGQEcR9/Ljn0ahapt6Fnqd3ayTGRS6ayQ8gHiRHoYflKUH//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587295045225,"updatedAt":1588403564673,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/l_756ce052626d4706a2d8aa7ed6abc5af.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
