Opening with the melancholic, slightly underwhelming twinkle of<em> Ode To Sailors</em>, by the time the group from Tours flow effortlessly into <em>Runaway</em>, you’ll be well and truly in love. With the playful vocals of lead singer Laure Berneau intertwining gorgeously with the glittering synth and guitar sections, <strong>Boys In Lilies</strong> carve out a sound that is immediately accesible, yet entirely their own. Check out EP highlight <em>The Bird</em> below, and the full EP under that. Well and truly one of the most beautiful new artists of 2013.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F97768051\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 626px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1104279185/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=false/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22699-introducing-boys-in-lilies","category":"introducing","date":1371833835000,"wpid":22699,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283358389,"updatedAt":1588441765045,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273009f8c2cdd5c41d7d5b62714.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
