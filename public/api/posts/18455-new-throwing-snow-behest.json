Now we have the second cut from his imminent new EP (Dec 3<sup>rd</sup>). Just under 5 minutes of masterfully executed and epically developed house music, in the loosest sense of the word. It’s grand in scope, weighty in its themes and frankly his EP’s release can’t come soon enough.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F68401241&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18455-new-throwing-snow-behest","category":"music","date":1353923198000,"wpid":18455,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284457190,"updatedAt":1588441773460,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/11/throwing-snow-close-165x109.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
