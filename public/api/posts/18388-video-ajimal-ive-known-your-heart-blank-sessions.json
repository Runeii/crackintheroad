Touches of <strong>Bon Iver</strong> and <strong>Jeff Buckley</strong> ring true throughout, however <strong>Ajimal</strong> sculpts an illimitable soundscape that is entirely his own. With a new mini-album entitled<strong><em> Childhood</em></strong> out early 2013, this immensely talented young songwriter is sure to have one hell of a year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9TSfcInPIE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18388-video-ajimal-ive-known-your-heart-blank-sessions","category":"music","date":1353449590000,"wpid":18388,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":533,"src":"2012/11/ajimal-by-ian-west-photography.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQI/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQREgX/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AzNScdfHuZ6+sg3KqNvXI0SZHEQP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284485804,"updatedAt":1588403535390,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/11/ajimal-by-ian-west-photography.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
