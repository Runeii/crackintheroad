Over It. – Where Your Nights Often End","content":"<p>I first stumbled upon <strong>Evan Weiss</strong> last year when he was over here touring with the equally wonderful (but entirely different) <strong><a title=\"Grown Ups myspace\" href=\"https://www.</p><p>myspace.com/ihategrownups\">Grown Ups</a></strong> and <strong><a title=\"SASO Tumblr\" href=\"https://shoesandsocksoff.tumblr.com/\">Shoes and Socks Off</a></strong>, between whom the Chicago-based songwriter occupied a sort of sonic middle ground, sharing the punk influence of the former and the songwriting nous of the latter. It’s a happy medium I always fall for, and for weeks afterward, the <strong><a title=\"IIOI site\" href=\"https://intoitoverit.com/\">Into It. Over It.</a></strong> record <em><strong>52 Weeks </strong></em>soundtracked my journeys to and from work. As the album’s name suggests, it’s 52 tracks in length, recorded one a week by <strong>Weiss </strong>over the space of one year, and as such it’s a record you can really get your teeth into, containing little to no filler into the bargain. The conceptual nature of the thing said a lot to me – I was mired in a job that I hated, using no creative skills whatsoever, and this was a record that had forced itself into artistic productivity. <em><strong>52 Weeks</strong></em> started me writing again, stopped me drinking so much, made me pick up a guitar when I got home, and generally helped pull back the curtain at the end of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>I don’t have that job anymore, but obviously I was still incredibly excited to learn that <strong>Weiss </strong>has recorded his debut LP proper (his other <strong>IIOI </strong>releases are six 7″ splits containing over their course 12 songs about American towns). In a continuation of <strong>Weiss</strong>‘ tradition for fitting record titles, the release is called – yep – <strong><em>Proper</em></strong>. A fortnight ago, <a title=\"AP IIOI Proper\" href=\"https://www.altpress.com/features/entry/exclusive_stream_into_it_over_its_proper/\">AP</a>‘s streaming of the <strong></strong> album’s title track showcased <strong>Into It. Over It.</strong>‘s more upbeat leanings, with its bold crunch and whoah whoah whoah’s, whilst <em><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/filter-magazine/into-it-over-it-where-your\">Where Your Nights Often End</a> </em>(debuted yesterday on <a title=\"Filter Where Your Nights Often End\" href=\"https://filtermagazine.com/index.php/media/entry/mp3_into_it._over_it._new_single_where_your_nights_often_end_filter_exclusi\">Filter</a>) finds <strong>Weiss </strong>in downtempo mode, a headspace equal to the song’s title. Musically, it’s all gently overdriven arpeggios and bittersweet melody, and <strong>Evan</strong>‘s final admission that he’ll ‘never make the lines out’ carries the kind of quiet, considered, and adult resignation that I seem to spend most of my time looking for in modern music. <strong><em>Proper </em></strong>is out via <a title=\"No Sleep\" href=\"https://nosleeprecs.com/\">No Sleep</a> records on the 27th of September, and you can preorder it <a title=\"No Sleep Store\" href=\"https://www.nosleepstore.com/artist/into-it-over-it\">here</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"10510-new-into-it-over-it-where-your-nights-often-end","category":"music","date":1314100722000,"wpid":10510,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/intoitoverit620-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgP/xAAkEAABAwQBAwUAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEAAURIQYHEhMiIzEycf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDERMx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBr1P6k3CLLsUFmG60iU4ovNtrJ8o+oSFDBIyfjR0KMp5hdI6Qz4bj7Y7PXFeKta2cbNR58oqv/AAUKJIM1QIP6ikDjrgcUA4sAE6yaJuaOCWqXEH//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294001673,"updatedAt":1588403549849,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2011/08/intoitoverit620-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
