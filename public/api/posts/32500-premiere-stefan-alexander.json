{"id":"5e9bf8c88fb2d30d7769cb0c","artists":["5e9b69447a1236eccfeb257c"],"title":"Premiere: Stefan Alexander – Skeleton","content":"<p>This debut single from NY’s <strong>Stefan Alexander</strong> is the definition of a bonafide earworm.</p><p> Penned as an ode to a close high school friend, and documenting the potential turmoils of blurring the lines between friendship and romance, it manages to remain insanely addictive whilst admirably honest. In his own words: “<span class=\"s1\">The friendship ended in such a confusing and terrible way that it forever changed how I thought about the longevity of any relationship, both romantic or platonic.”</span></p>\n<p>Influence wise, there are touches of the slickness of Justin Timberlake, married with the candor of the likes of SOHN or Chet Faker. All in all, big ambition, huge sound and plenty to get excited about. Check out <em>Skeleton</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/274645507%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-8uIWN&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"32500-premiere-stefan-alexander","category":"music","date":1469110278000,"wpid":32500,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587280072075,"updatedAt":1588442051041,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2016/07/stefan-alexander-promo-photo.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
