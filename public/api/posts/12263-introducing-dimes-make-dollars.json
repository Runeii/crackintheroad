Timing, seduction, lust and a slickly refined beat, all combining to make this one hell of an exciting first appearance from <strong>Dimes Make Dollars</strong>. Check out the self-titled track below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=207892237/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://dimesmakedollars.bandcamp.com/track/dimes-make-dollars\">Dimes Make Dollars by Dimes Make Dollars</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12263-introducing-dimes-make-dollars","category":"introducing","date":1320342359000,"wpid":12263,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293566697,"updatedAt":1587825911846,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
