Lyrically it’s spot on as well; with “<em>and when your heart attacks, you’ll be screaming my name</em>” being a particularly poignant highlight. Check out <em>Roman Candles</em> below, and download it for free if you fancy.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2690357851/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14353-new-mpfree-mirror-lady-roman-candles","category":"mpfree","date":1327273672000,"wpid":14353,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293027292,"updatedAt":1588441783261,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27350b4036d44573d98198a74b9.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
