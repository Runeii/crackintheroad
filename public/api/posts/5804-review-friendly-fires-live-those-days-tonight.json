Trailing the album release is their comeback single “Live Those Days Tonight” and it is a beauty of a record to return with.</p>\n<p>Eschewing the po-faced seriousness that blights many bands comebacks after a hugely successful debut. “Live Those days..” is a continuation of the bright, club influenced pop that characterized their debut. A hook filled paean to club culture, going out and living for the moment it brims with excitement and vibrancy.</p>\n<p>All manner of sounds and instruments create a heady cocktail of peerless dance pop which is highly percussive and, more importantly, highly danceable. Friendly Fires are the sound of summer 2011, expect to hear this everywhere.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F12375454\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F12375454\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/listenbeforeyoubuy/friendly-fires-live-those-days\">Friendly Fires – Live Those Days Tonight</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/listenbeforeyoubuy\">ListenBeforeYouBuy</a></span></p>\n","slug":"5804-review-friendly-fires-live-those-days-tonight","category":"music","date":1301060218000,"wpid":5804,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":368,"src":"2011/06/09317_153436_friendlyfires210309_de.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAgEAABBAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAFEiEGIlHS/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQP/xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDESEx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCW6/T6OB4SxtJutEtapMHkSshVOB4qSKr1ISnr6Mmq5bPNXJly77pwfnGMI64Vsbyf/9k="},"createdAt":1587294602858,"updatedAt":1588403558566,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d33","old_image":"2011/06/09317_153436_friendlyfires210309_de.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
