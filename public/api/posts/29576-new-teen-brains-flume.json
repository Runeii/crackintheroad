The have now followed it up with an equally great track that solidifies them as one of my favourite finds of the year. <em>Flume</em> is another short and sweet slice of hazy pop and sounds not too dissimilar to the dream like sounds of Brooklyn’s DIIV.</p>\n<p>It’s fuzzed out guitars and reverb drenched production doesn’t let up for the entirety of the track and makes a brief 2 minute track drift through your head for a whole lot longer.
