Sleek and almost at times almost unimaginably beautiful, it’s a very promising first step for what could well be one of the albums of 2014.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135470336&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26902-new-hundred-waters-rafters","category":"music","date":1392847281000,"wpid":26902,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2014/02/artworks-000071215886-umreuv-t500x500.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYH/8QAIBAAAgEEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFERITISIxUf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAYEQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAISMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AwN8HMUaJIhI3HZO9aoVsLdBiCo7GriNiL24AJ10mol2bm3kff2jbpIcR7f/Z"},"createdAt":1587282399136,"updatedAt":1588403518779,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/02/artworks-000071215886-umreuv-t500x500.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
