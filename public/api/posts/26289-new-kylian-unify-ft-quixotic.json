The vocals are most certainly Emily, so I’m guessing the instrumentals are from Quixotic. Either way the collaboration works, giving birth to the purest kind of electronic music. Forgive the following cliché sentence, but these two seem to <em>unify </em>quite well. I’d love to hear the story about how they met and made this track as Kansas City is quite a ways away from good ol’ Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/130700301″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"26289-new-kylian-unify-ft-quixotic","category":"new","date":1390340644000,"wpid":26289,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1500,"height":1092,"src":"2014/01/kylianbg.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIBAAAQQDAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABQYSEyEx8f/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAZEQADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRITH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJrTdVxsfjdJr2ZMiAoOBcr0R7U74/aVEpNpVdEfuZtP2fOOTpC2ohDanFFICaoX8Yxi3KnaCTOen//Z"},"createdAt":1587282507612,"updatedAt":1588403520700,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"2014/01/kylianbg.jpg","categories":["new"]}
