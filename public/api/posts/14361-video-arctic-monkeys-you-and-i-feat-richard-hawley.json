Richard Hawley)","content":"<p>Set to be the b-side to upcoming single<em> Black Treacle</em>, <strong>Arctic Monkeys</strong> have released a hastily shot promo video for <em>You And I</em>, featuring close friend <strong>Richard Hawley</strong> on lead vocals.</p><p> Showing the group laying down the track in a studio with the Sheffield crooner, it’s a very tongue in cheek affair, exhausting the quintessential worn down British cliches. The track itself continues in a similar vein to <em><strong>Suck It And See</strong></em> material, proving extremely 60’s inspired complete with soaring guitar riffs and coarse vocals. Recorded under the <strong>Death Ramps</strong> moniker, it’s the first time the group have used this title since releasing a limited edition 7″ single back in 2008. Check out <em>You And I</em> below, set to feature on <em>Black Treacle</em>, out 23 January.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zXkAaoBOLU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14361-video-arctic-monkeys-you-and-i-feat-richard-hawley","category":"music","date":1327336942000,"wpid":14361,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293023531,"updatedAt":1588441783206,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ed0552e9746ed2bbf04ae4bcb5525700ca31522d.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
