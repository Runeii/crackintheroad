Each track comes in at about 1.30 minutes in length, but what it lacks in length it more than makes up for in subtle progression and sparse and desolate textures.</p>\n<p>In essence, the EP is an instrumental hip-hop record. The beats snap and pop with a certain flair and the time signatures, at least on the surface, remain true to formula. The instrumentation surrounding the tracks however, breathe life into the beast. The whole thing is wrapped in a haze of sedation, the samples praying on gentle repetition of samples, while subtle changes in the groove jolt the listener out of a forced trance. Your head will not stop nodding.</p>\n<p>Stream and D/L the EP below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=4196088/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"10367-new-knxwledge-komposure-ep2","category":"music","date":1313779829000,"wpid":10367,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":552,"src":"2011/08/knxwledge.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAIBAAAQQCAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABSExEhUycf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AnO83Gi9DqoMhDbIbVIlpA+7oEJNc9jsd/nOPLlatqW822maUIWpIvwugcYyC/9k="},"createdAt":1587294020484,"updatedAt":1588403550102,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/08/knxwledge.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
