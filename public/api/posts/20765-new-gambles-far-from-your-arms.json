However the cliche is an unfortunate factor outside of the control of Gambles himself, and rather it is a symptom of what has been a relentless emergence of male (and female) singer-songwriters in the past few years. In this haze of a plethora of shaky vocals and plucky guitars, Gambles stands above with a humble mastery that sparks thoughts of Crack in the Road favourites <strong>M O N E Y</strong>. While Jamie Lee employs a more poetic vernacular, they share a galvanizing vulnerability that immediately strikes and remains with you in a resonating emotional echo.</p>\n<p><em>You breathe my lungs, you keep me strong</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84477063\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20765-new-gambles-far-from-your-arms","category":"mpfree","date":1365020953000,"wpid":20765,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283678225,"updatedAt":1588441767422,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/bb91fae6dda1ae0c66c43d3819b4196efcec8938.jpg","categories":["mpfree","newmpfree","new","music","newnews"]}
