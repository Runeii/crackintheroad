{"id":"5e9c34289b6559241525e1a2","title":"Interview: Great Lake Swimmers","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Compared to <strong>Nick Drake </strong>and <strong>Iron and Wine</strong>, the Canadian folk band <strong>Great Lake Swimmers </strong>have created, through fantastic acoustic mastery, a sound that is encased with a serene spirituality.</p><p> Led by lead vocalist <strong>Tony Dekker, </strong>the <strong>Great Lake Swimmers</strong> have already released four full length albums and toured across the world. Such amazing achievements, I believe, are in the most part down to intimate nature of the music the <strong>Great Lake Swimmers</strong> produce. <strong>Tony Dekker</strong>‘s majestic lyrical construction makes the listener feel as if they are the only person in the audience, leaving one in a state of belief that one had a personal window into the woven meanings contained in every song. This emphasis on carefully crafted lyrics and well orchestrated instrumentals have led the <strong>Great Lake Swimmers </strong>to be considered one of the finest Folk bands of today. Therefore <strong>Crack In The Road</strong> were delighted when <strong>Tony</strong> kindly agreed to answer some of our questions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> If you had to cite one band/artist as a major influence upon you, who would it be?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Leonard Cohen.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> What has been your favourite gigging experience to date?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Touring in China.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> How much do you feel growing up in the rural surroundings of Wainfleet affected your music?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>It’s definitely a deep source for me. When I sit down and think about something about the natural world that I feel I may have a unique perspective on, it always comes back to that.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> Your sound has been described as ‘spiritual folk’ weaved within a ‘melodic melancholy’. Do you agree with this assessment? If so, what has inspired you to create such a sound?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>It’s difficult for me to agree with this assessment. I think the media is very quick to put labels on things, though I understand that people need reference points. I’m not sure what inspired my sound. The songs just came out that way.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> You have been reported as saying your lyrics are deliberately left open for interpretation. Is this to encourage a more active listener and to make the relationship between artist and audience more intimate?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>I think the songs are designed so that the deeper you get into them the more rewarding they are. I try to write songs that stand on their own lyrically.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> You released your fourth full length album last year ‘Lost Channels’; can we expect any further releases from the Great Lake Swimmers in the near future? If so, how has the sound evolved, if at all?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>I think the sound is continually evolving. We just released an EP of live, acoustic versions of ‘Lost Channels’ called ‘the Legion Sessions.’ Other than that, I hope we can get back into the studio soon. I’m excited about developing the band chemistry with the lineup that we have now.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> And most importantly, when do you plan to tour the UK again?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>We toured in the UK twice in 2009 but unfortunately don’t have any plans to return just yet. Hopefully something comes up soon.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> PC or Mac?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>PC for work & Mac for fun.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CITR:</em> If you could have any super power, what would it be and why?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Invisibility. It’s self-explanatory.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/greatlakeswimmers\" target=\"_blank\">Check out Great Lake Swimmers’ Myspace!</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/likebox.php?id=114090381951328&width=292&connections=10&stream=false&header=false&height=255\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:292px; height:255px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"831-5-minutes-with-great-lake-swimmers","category":"interviews","date":1274000642000,"wpid":831,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":400,"src":"2010/05/great-lake-swimmers.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIhAAAgEDAwUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFBiExBxESQVFh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAZEQEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABECAyH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM9xWvNXY1LKxxV1GIbGBYx4gRq678jnhx+gqDV9L1U02kjpdYG6e4UkSOFj7M3s7t9pSo8Wmo2zoT//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587295272593,"updatedAt":1588403567826,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2010/05/great-lake-swimmers.jpg","categories":["interviews","music"]}
