Having well and truly ditched the chillwave sound, Bundick also ramps up the production and cost in the video, which in truth, is more glitzy <strong>Frank Ocean</strong> than DIY <strong>Toro y Moi</strong> that we’d experienced in the past.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0_ardwzTrA\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18698-video-toro-y-moi-so-many-details","category":"music","date":1355340419000,"wpid":18698,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284355158,"updatedAt":1588441772680,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/toro-y-moi-503191b8d6888.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
