Whether there’s a connection between more favourable weather and levels of inspiration, I wouldn’t be qualified enough to say, however it’s undoubted that the summer brings with it a plethora of fantastic new music.</p>\n<p><strong>Noble Oak’s</strong> new cut <em>Escape Night</em> showcases exactly why he’s one of the most exciting producer around, with it’s euphoria inducing synths and deep house influenced beats. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, this is music to fall head over heels in love to, and with. Let’s runaway together.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39926433&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15680-new-noble-oak-escape-night","category":"music","date":1331996330000,"wpid":15680,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292654567,"updatedAt":1588441779987,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/d62bca342de00a78408355ad46e1c6bd152bf02d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
