Despite blogs (including us) drumming the genius of these LA brats down your throat, their ability to surprise and change the rules of the game with such ease is remarkable to watch. When listening to Frank Ocean’s debut mix tape Nostalgia, Ultra it’s hard to believe he’s related artistically to Tyler, the Creator. Despite the obvious stylistic differences, the youthful, self produced and self-realised theme that runs through the heart of OFWGKTA’s work is as evident here as ever.</p>\n<p>Songs For Women is perhaps the most self-assured on the record. Honest, charming and above all else real, it takes the story telling of someone like Drake and adds a sense of humour that makes it sound unbelievably fresh.
