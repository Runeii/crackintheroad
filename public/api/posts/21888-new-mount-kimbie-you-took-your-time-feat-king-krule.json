King Krule)","content":"<p>So with the release of <strong>Mount Kimbie</strong>’s sophomore effort edging steadily closer, we’ve been gifted with one of the most anticipated collaborations from the record.</p><p> It features the 2 artists working together amongst diverging currents, <strong>Kimbie</strong> are established, <strong>Krule</strong> is perfecting and honing his craft. Sonically this sentiment is mirrored, with the instrumentation allowing <strong>Krule</strong> to centre stage. A stage that <strong>Krule</strong> finds himself incredibly comfortable on, loosing his apathetic drawl at times in favour of a growl or a howl. The whole thing is a mass of claustrophobic urges and introspective aggression – it stinks of something nasty, something that’s only likely to reveal itself after repeated listens.</p>\n<p><em>Cold Spring Fault</em> <em>Less</em> will be released on On May 28.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F92148205\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21888-new-mount-kimbie-you-took-your-time-feat-king-krule","category":"music","date":1368648627000,"wpid":21888,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283507246,"updatedAt":1588441766476,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/69fb04c9a7d9d4c9470e62445c4075e6838aa6c9.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
