Again, the lyrics are insightful yet tinged with spite;<em> ‘With your bloodshot eyes and your calloused mind, do you really think you’re gonna fool us tonight?’</em>. Two very different tracks, both with admirable qualities, allowing for an extremely positive first release from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Orca-Orca/252311724808097\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Orca Orca</strong></a>.
