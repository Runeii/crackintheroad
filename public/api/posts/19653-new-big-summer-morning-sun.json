Almost sounding like it should be soundtracking a slightly cheesy American sit-com, it’s languid, beach-pop vibes are sure to earn it praise from all the slickest blogs, and certainly serve to keep me on the edge of my seat for future releases. Music this sunny could only come from Barcelona. Check out <em>Morning Sun</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1603975475/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"410\" width=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19653-new-big-summer-morning-sun","category":"music","date":1360518801000,"wpid":19653,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284001174,"updatedAt":1588441770581,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/bc7cbb3d9989507530facdbc6ad21c3c49db0089.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
