Jerky Foals-esque guitars paired with epic, soaring vocals and a healthy dose of early 00’s American pop-punk, makes <em>Dukkha</em> an invigorating and engrossing listen, and is sure to form the foundations of further success for<strong> Arbeia</strong>. Check it out below, and be sure to get there early for their show at <a href=\"https://www.generator.org.uk/EVOLUTIONEMERGING\" target=\"_blank\">Evolution Emerging</a> this Saturday, 7.45 at The Cumberland Arms.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F93360641\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F58777554\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22075-premiere-arbeia-dukkha","category":"music","date":1369317629000,"wpid":22075,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283470328,"updatedAt":1588441766228,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273be3879690140ea7d211b7d61.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
