Stop banging on about it then, everyone who’s going knows all this”</em><br />\nThat’s very true – especially as lots of people who couldn’t go also know all of this – but there are many reasons to still be interested. As tradition, the organisers are staging a Warmup event at <em>Corsica Studios </em>in Elephant & Castle, London on 3rd August. Half live artist performances, half DJ shows, it pits festival curators <strong>Laurel Collective </strong>alongside last year’s performers<strong> Post War Years </strong>and <strong>Clout!, </strong>to offer a taste of what you missed last year (though <strong>Anais Mitchell</strong> and <strong>Alt-J, </strong>both acts from last year who aren’t in attendance, should give an added taste of what the festival offers). It also showcases new talent from <strong>Eugene McGuinness </strong>and the now-performing-solo keyboardist of Micachu and the Shapes, <strong>Raisa K, </strong>DJing under her solo name alongside…er, <strong>Micachu.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Doors open </strong><strong>from Seven</strong>, and it runs all through the evening until 3am, so this is definitely one to attend. Want more reason? Throughout the night, <strong>pairs of tickets will be given away for the now <em>sold out</em> festival in September. </strong>Tickets for the warmup event itself are currently available for £12, a bargain for four live performances and enough music to tide you over until 3am.</p>\n<p>Schedule and listenable things below, we’ll see you there.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Performing:</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Live<br />\n</span>20:00 – Clout!</strong></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=275149547/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>21:00 – Post War Years</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F50803667&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true&color=ff7700\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>22:00 – Laurel Collective</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F43000911&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true&color=ff7700\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>23:00 – Eugene McGuinness</strong></p>\n<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR5B54Dvzu0</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spinning Tunes</span></strong><br />\n<strong>00:00 – Micachu + Raisa K</strong><br />\n<strong>01:00 – Nightwave</strong><br />\n<strong>02:00 – Dauwd</strong></p>\n<p><a title=\"In the Woods Warmup Event\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/500581796634911/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook listing</a><br />\n<a title=\"Buy Tickets\" href=\"https://www.fatsoma.com/tickets/in-the-woods-warm-up-show/corsica-studios/london/e68135\" target=\"_blank\">Buy Tickets</a><br />\n<a title=\"In the Woods\" href=\"https://www.inthewoodsfestival.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">In the Woods Festival</a></p>\n","slug":"17349-in-the-woods-2012-warmup","category":"events","date":1342101300000,"wpid":17349,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":110,"src":"2012/07/301068_224081470974269_200752039973879_560560_5648222_n-165x110.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIxAAAgEDAgcBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRBQYHEhMjMTJBgf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCF0DijeQ7duLSG1g78fSaNECqeVADkYI9f2s5bc+qRsUjvLpI1OFUMMKPg8UpQwGoQy//Z"},"createdAt":1587284915778,"updatedAt":1588443773270,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2012/07/301068_224081470974269_200752039973879_560560_5648222_n-165x110.jpg","categories":["events","live-reviews","music"]}
