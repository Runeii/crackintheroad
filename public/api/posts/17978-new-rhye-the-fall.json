Having now signed to Polydor for their debut EP, entitled <strong><em>The Fall</em></strong>, out 9 October, the title track from said release premiered on <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14330-the-fall/\" target=\"_blank\">Pitchfork</a> this afternoon. More upbeat than Open, The Fall is unashamedly pop, and as slick as a Lana Del Rey H&M advert, with every vocal twist and violin line carefully considered, ensuring no details go amiss. Check out <em>The Fall</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F61382310\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17978-new-rhye-the-fall","category":"music","date":1348778272000,"wpid":17978,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":620,"height":413,"src":"2012/09/rhye-open.jpeg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAeEAACAQUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAUREjEGIf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCM+ZyUeDzl9A1tFPFdrG57QHa8klTv0bWpy7WGS6mfkL05OgPwbPlKUH//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284673602,"updatedAt":1588403536211,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/09/rhye-open.jpeg","categories":["music","new"]}
