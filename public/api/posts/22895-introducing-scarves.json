Seattle trio <strong>Scarves</strong> embody that same loveably raw and twee lyrical playfulness that the aforementioned acts thrived upon.</p><p> With their debut three track EP, entitled<strong><em> TV</em></strong>, they boldly demonstrate their unique personality, most notably through the story-telling ambition within each track, be it the lovelorn <em>Tag!</em> or the angst-y <em>Broken Branches</em>.
