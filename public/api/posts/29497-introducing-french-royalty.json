There’s a real memorable kick to French Royalty, and definitely enough to suggest that they’re well worth keeping an eye on. Check out the full EP below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 588px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4289892693/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"https://frenchroyalty.bandcamp.com/album/french-royalty\">French Royalty by French Royalty</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29497-introducing-french-royalty","category":"introducing","date":1408357369000,"wpid":29497,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281977109,"updatedAt":1587825845406,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
