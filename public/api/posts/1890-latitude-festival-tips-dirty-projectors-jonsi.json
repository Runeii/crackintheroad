Couple this with a working relationship with David Byrne, it truly seems like “there’s nothing we can’t do” – this quote coming from Dirty Projectors themselves, in the lyrics to single ‘Stillness is the Move’. With their soaring harmonies and unusual drum beats, it will be hard to resist a dance on the main stage on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Also on Sunday comes one of only two UK festival performances from the Sigur Rós frontman Jónsi. With a five piece band including none other than Nico Muhly (who scored the orchestral arrangements for Jónsi’s album, as well as previously working with Grizzly Bear [another one to watch at Latitude], Antony and the Johnsons and Philip Glass), Jónsi’s stage performance is already looking promising – and that’s not even mentioning the theatrical stage set up. 59 Productions have done a magnificent job of truly bringing Jónsi’s <em>Go</em> to life, through a series of enchanting animations – in an interview with BBC Radio 1, Jónsi described his album as ‘playful’ and ‘colourful’, and 59 Productions have managed to perfectly translate this to the stage. For a glimpse of Jónsi’s stage set up, please see 59 Productions website <a href=\"https://www.59productions.co.uk/news_post?n=34\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n","slug":"1890-latitude-festival-tips-dirty-projectors-jonsi","category":"festivals","date":1279098111000,"wpid":1890,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1274,"height":719,"src":"2010/07/4351609939_a0c775db2a_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIxAAAQMCBQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAARBQYTISISFDEyUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCfw7JjmcYeLGTJ7CbFSJrKkOKfSkojja56SArTPj12te1YYAw6NRTAuvkeX2lKuquxv//Z"},"createdAt":1587295121449,"updatedAt":1588403565580,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d14","old_image":"2010/07/4351609939_a0c775db2a_o.jpg","categories":["festivals","music"]}
