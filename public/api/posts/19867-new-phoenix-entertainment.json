{"id":"5e9c07e2774c2610387e4fbd","artists":["5e9b69317a1236eccfeb2430"],"title":"New: Phoenix – Entertainment","content":"<p>Since the release of the excellent <em><strong>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</strong> </em>back in 2009, <strong>Phoenix</strong> have deservedly become a pretty big deal, playing huge gigs at places like <a title=\"Phoenix at Madison Square Garden\" href=\"https://www.</p><p>youtube.com/watch?v=nWD2rmpoYeM&list=UUNDAbwbXmmgosddFdUyRWwg&index=3\" target=\"_blank\">Madison Square Garden</a> and the <a title=\"Phoenix - Take Away Show\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHwucdjtkgU\" target=\"_blank\">Eiffel Tower</a> (well, kind-of). But the downside has been we haven’t had any new music from the Parisian boys for a while – until now. After recently releasing more details on their forthcoming L.P,<em> <strong>Bankrupt!</strong></em>, they’ve now dropped the first single, <em>Entertainment, </em>as Zane Lowe’s hottest record in the world today on BBC Radio 1.</p>\n<p>They haven’t reined in the high-end, synth led production since their last outing – it’s slick, grandiose, and according to the current highest rated comment on the very professional looking ‘homemade’ YouTube lyric video, even has a bit of “japanese vibe” going on. But it’s when the song drops down in the verses – to the tried-and-tested driving sound of bass, muted guitars and steady drums – there’s space given for the welcome reminder that in Thomas Mars, <strong>Phoenix </strong>have a lead singer with a seriously fine ear for great, catchy melodies. It’s good to have them back.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/86_TqlVQscQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19867-new-phoenix-entertainment","category":"music","date":1361218029000,"wpid":19867,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283938078,"updatedAt":1588441770254,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d1a","old_image":"generated/4547d3204aad5959d55d8cc73ddcedfef4865671.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
