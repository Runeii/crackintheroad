In about an hour or so the UK album charts are set to be announced, and it’s fairly likely that Foals will have achieved their first number one record, so it seems fitting that this track from Brisbane’s Twin Haus takes a Foals-esque sound, and does it far better than anything on Holy Fire.</p>\n<p>Lumberjack Loveshack (Part 1) is as melodic and brooding as it is epic; a true masterpiece of a track.
