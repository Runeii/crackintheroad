Never Enough is a slick yet emotionally fraught number, placing itself amongst the likes of BROODS, CHVRCHES and St. Lucia, with it’s glossy production and EMILIE’s impeccable vocal. Never Enough is released 10 March 2017, check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/305980648%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-X25If&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33279-premiere-emilie-never-enough","category":"music","date":1486470944000,"wpid":33279,"isSticky":true,"featured_image":{"width":1092,"height":718,"src":"2017/02/16587282_1860242560927652_1817805408613282774_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUI/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQFEhEUITFB/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAAH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM9Y3otxFyO7ERZnIdVn1Dg3QO3B+jnlqgkefSIrJXC//9k="},"createdAt":1587279924771,"updatedAt":1588403502757,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/02/16587282_1860242560927652_1817805408613282774_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
