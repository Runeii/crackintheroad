Here’s hoping they can follow up <em>LIGHTS WALKED OUT</em> with another joyous slice of psychedelic pop.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F38457367%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-LF90m&show_artwork=true&secret_url=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15443-new-l-a-d-d-e-r-s-lights-walked-out","category":"music","date":1330695177000,"wpid":15443,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":160,"src":"2012/03/3531988442-1-165x160.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABP/EACQQAAIBAwMDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAEEQUTIQYHQRQiMTLx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQJR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwB1pvz9Zz6FMpiWCy9VMwb3bobIGfIKMR+U27l1VbuZYbJ2iDsEYFeRng/NHtwB3N1Rx9zaOpbyRtpxmm5J5JOadziRDj6f/9k="},"createdAt":1587292721876,"updatedAt":1588443775360,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/3531988442-1-165x160.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
