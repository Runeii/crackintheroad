Seemingly heavy on the <strong>Flying Lotus</strong> influence, it morphs the original almost beyond recognition, introducing a drum and bass inspired element to the track. As the comments on Soundcloud indicate, this remix goes hard and almost feels like it should be soundtracking a sci-fi horror flick. Mindfuck all round.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28091400\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28091400\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/s-maharba/kuhn-stoneskipper-s-maharba\">Kuhn – Stoneskipper (S.Maharba Remix)</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/s-maharba\">S.Maharba</a></span> </p>\n","slug":"12649-new-kuhn-stoneskipper-s-maharba-remix","category":"music","date":1321553048000,"wpid":12649,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293445561,"updatedAt":1587825910167,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","remixes","new"]}
