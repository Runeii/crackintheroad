Basically she’s good at everything. Her compellingly intricate collage style is a strange retro-inspired mix of science fiction short stories and the Surrealist and Dadaist movements. More specifically she has referenced John Stezaker’s surreal collages and Storm Thorgerson’s record covers.</p>\n<p>Heidi is taking part in STITCH which will be exhibiting at Cock ‘n’ Bull Gallery, Shoreditch, from January 16<sup>th</sup> to February 7<sup>th</sup>. The work that will be on show is part of her ‘Glitch’ series.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2014/01/heidi3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25892\" alt=\"heidi3\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi3.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"706\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi3.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi3-212x300.jpg 212w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi3-35x50.jpg 35w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25893\" alt=\"heidi2\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi2.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi2.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi2-221x300.jpg 221w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi2-37x50.jpg 37w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25894\" alt=\"heidi1\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi1.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi1.jpg 670w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi1-600x600.jpg 600w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi1-100x100.jpg 100w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/heidi1-50x50.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Heidi’s ‘Glitch’ series uses images moved around on a scanner, which form sensitive and beautiful representations of glitch art. The digital flaws  created form otherworldly bodies as worked from photographs of people. These are essentially movements captured on a two- dimensional surface. In this way the beauty of imperfection is reintroduced to the precision of digital imaging. The glitched images have very intricate, delicate lines and marks, actually making these imperfections become precise.</p>\n<p>What is most exciting about the work is that most of the selection has been made specifically for the exhibition, which demonstrates how fresh, spontaneous and even crafted working with a scanner can be.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cocknbullgallery.com/?p=969\">https://www.cocknbullgallery.com/?p=969</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cargocollective.com/stitchlondon\">https://cargocollective.com/stitchlondon</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.heidiandreasen.com\">https://www.heidiandreasen.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"25868-artist-profile-heidi-andreasen","category":"arts","date":1389283242000,"wpid":25868,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1181,"height":844,"src":"2014/01/glitched_3-rgb-1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIRAAAQQBAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABBBEDBRITISMxQWH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//EABkRAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgQRMv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A1TUpUvjEMGTIUppkcd/I49sia/lUxdPapHu3rwiKdV7HWK50j//Z"},"createdAt":1587282591375,"updatedAt":1588403522224,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d2e","old_image":"2014/01/glitched_3-rgb-1.jpg","categories":["arts"]}
