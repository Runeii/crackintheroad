All combined with the spliced together, borrowed visuals, this debut track is one of the most exciting, and progressive first outings of the year. It’s understandably still very days for the duo, and it’ll most likely be a while before the dust settles from the explosion that Through The Fire deserves to create, however<strong> Arkon Fly</strong> just marked themselves out as an early ‘one to watch’ for 2014.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/x_J4kyAkhr4\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23773-video-arkon-fly-through-the-fire","category":"music","date":1376317875000,"wpid":23773,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283108166,"updatedAt":1588441763431,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27387a833be68262f23ddfe0991.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
