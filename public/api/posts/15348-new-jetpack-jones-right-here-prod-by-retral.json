By Retral)","content":"<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/JetpackJones\">Jetpack Jones</a></strong> (previously<strong> <a title=\"New: VenoM – Jupiter or Mars (Prod. by Handbook)\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/11033-new-venom-jupiter-or-mars-prod-by-handbook/\">Venom</a></strong>) has become my go to when it comes to inspiring and ‘feel-good’ hip-hip. At his best he’s boyishly confident and idealistic, at his worst, he sounds like your juvenile ex-boyfriend. To be honest, the latter still manages to come across as wonderfully charming.
