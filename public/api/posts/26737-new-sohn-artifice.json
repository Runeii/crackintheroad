Earlier this evening he announced his debut album, titled <em><strong>Tremors</strong></em>, set to be released 7 April via 4AD, with new track<em> Artifice</em> set to be featured on the LP.</p>\n<p>As with his work with BANKS and Kwabs, the production is as immaculate as ever, and his songwriting is as magical as to be expected. More upbeat than his initial offerings, it’s further proof that SOHN is destined for a colossal year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9btsq496hkQ\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26737-new-sohn-artifice","category":"music","date":1392230645000,"wpid":26737,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282433033,"updatedAt":1588441760331,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/02/bgtbvkrceaab_sq-950x629.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
