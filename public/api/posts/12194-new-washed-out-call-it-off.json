As always with <strong>Washed Out</strong>, the percussion section is exaggerated and builds throughout the track, maintaining a steady, wholesome feel. Check out <em>Call It Off</em> below.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26832139\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26832139\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/weirdworldrecordco/washed-out-call-it-off\">Washed Out – Call It Off</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/weirdworldrecordco\">WeirdWorldRecordCo</a></span></p>\n<p>Image sourced from <a href=\"https://thenjunderground.com/blog/2011/7/25/washed-out-covers-chris-isaaks-wicked-game-live-on-siriusxm.html\" target=\"_blank\">The NJ Underground</a>.</p>\n","slug":"12194-new-washed-out-call-it-off","category":"music","date":1320075065000,"wpid":12194,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":531,"src":"2011/10/ernest-greene-washed-out.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAIBAAAQMEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEBRIGIRMUQf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDLyeU47cmyz7Tqktex431hszLQEADWYlQHR+mqPZC0LyyGetjSlB//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293591541,"updatedAt":1588403545275,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/10/ernest-greene-washed-out.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
