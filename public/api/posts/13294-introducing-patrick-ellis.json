Anyway, another person who I’m sure would love to see the return of <strong>The Avalanches</strong> is Berlin based producer <strong>Patrick Ellis</strong>. Working as a developer for Soundcloud, it’s doesn’t come as a surprise to hear his eclectic array of inspirations seep through in his music. His debut three track release is a combination of hip-hop inspired samples and chillwave beats, proving both insanely danceable and wonderfully engaging.</p>\n<p>Of the trio of cuts that make up <strong><em>Another Day on Altair IV</em></strong>, it’s the two minute <em>Pop Pop Disco</em> that shines the brightest, cartwheeling energetically over a spliced percussion section. There are touches of <strong>Star Slinger</strong> amongst the sampling techniques, preferring to extract short bursts and yelps rather than complete vocal sections, before the track tumbles into the dream pop inspired <em>All Colour</em>. All lazy comparisons aside, this is an extremely promising release from <strong>Patrick Ellis</strong>, and should <strong>The Avalanches</strong> never return, we can at least be thankful that they promoted the spawn of music with such vibrancy as this. Check out<em> Pop Pop Disco</em> below, and head over to <strong>Patrick Ellis’s</strong> <a href=\"https://ellis.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> to cop the full release.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13688820\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13688820\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/patrickellis/pop-pop-disco\">Pop Pop Disco</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/patrickellis\">Patrick Ellis</a></span> </p>\n","slug":"13294-introducing-patrick-ellis","category":"introducing","date":1324390327000,"wpid":13294,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/12/artworks-000009397346-mw7v0u-crop-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwIG/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABEhBhIUkgUyU//EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAGxEAAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDBBEUMVH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANT4zT/Kjfe4XbjDXvSnS0gPsvaphmkRbJI6jAwxFJyZ/tL3NRrqJb7FcZdZ/9k="},"createdAt":1587293214020,"updatedAt":1588403543889,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/12/artworks-000009397346-mw7v0u-crop-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
