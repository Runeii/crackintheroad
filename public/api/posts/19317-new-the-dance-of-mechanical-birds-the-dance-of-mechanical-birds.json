Seventeen minutes of twisted vocals, collected recordings and slightly menacing guitars, this self-titled track is one of the most ambitious pieces of recording you’ll hear all year. Part <strong>Sigur Ros</strong>, part <strong>Mogwai</strong>, not only is it an experience in itself, it’s a brilliant one at that. Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=4035477075/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19317-new-the-dance-of-mechanical-birds-the-dance-of-mechanical-birds","category":"mpfree","date":1359129786000,"wpid":19317,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284093400,"updatedAt":1587825880197,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
