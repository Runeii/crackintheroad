There’s a tension bubbling underneath ‘Blue Cologne’, giving it enough edge to avoid slipping into tedium, while remaining a pleasant listen.</p>\n<p>You can give the track a spin below, maybe even grab a pair of headphones and chill in the sun. Sam Thomas’ debut album, <i>Blind Theatre</i>, is coming out soon on Just Music and you’ll be able grab it at the usual places. Peace.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F94438899%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-sCxTT\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23153-new-sam-thomas-blue-cologne","category":"music","date":1374231853000,"wpid":23153,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283266310,"updatedAt":1588441764396,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2731bfb4ca8e0bd95dc6f393176.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
