There’s the <strong>Miike Snow</strong>-esque title track, which is an unashamed pop number in every sense of the word, yet the other two tracks that make up <em><strong>Float</strong></em> show a more reserved side to <strong>KO KO</strong>. <em>Intermission</em> comes across like a highly polished <strong>Youth Lagoon</strong>, with the lead singer weeping, “I’ll pay you back if you can drive me home, I’ll stay the night if you are there alone”. Alright, so it’s coated in an ever so sweet film, added to by the immaculate production values, yet that said, I can’t help but be enchanted by <strong>KO KO</strong>.</p>\n<p>Check out the entire EP below, and grab a free download if it tickles your fancy.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"355\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 355px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2795294338/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://longlivekoko.bandcamp.com/album/float\">Float by KO KO</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15567-introducing-ko-ko","category":"introducing","date":1331323168000,"wpid":15567,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":164,"src":"2012/03/2272565025-1-165x164.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgYHCP/EACIQAAICAQQBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQhAAUGETESF0Fxof/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AEiTmHJYZnuq9aMdKpgWJXXod4Pn7OfnRe4W6Nk7VTJOewkmf3WruF7bRTjkLJSrKxi9RIiUHvOfGpNduWUu2FSxMqrIwADkADvQUmG3/9k="},"createdAt":1587292697353,"updatedAt":1588443775103,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/2272565025-1-165x164.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
