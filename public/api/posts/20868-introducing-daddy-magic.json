Buckcherry.</p><p> Those guys are awful. Anyway, the first twenty seconds or so of <strong>Daddy Magic’s</strong> <em>Tug</em> sounds a little bit like the Californian rockers, thankfully, that’s the only comparison, and it’s not long before the song descends into a brilliantly frantic, self-depreciating pop-punk barrage. <em>‘It’s alright / I know you’ve been hurt / but I’m just too sick to apologize / I’ll get my day of repentance babe’</em> bemoans Daddy Magic during the almost Strokes-esque chorus. On the flip-side <em>Another Tonight</em>, veers into ‘love-song’ territory, whilst remaining stoically tongue in cheek and wonderfully upbeat.
