In many ways it’s perhaps a simple fact to fill some space until the eventual soundcloud link, a fact to impress your mates when you talk of ‘that new hot producer’, whatever, people are talking about it. For me though it’s fundamental to the music. <strong>S O H N</strong> has even been quoted as describing himself as an “old-school songwriter who happens to love electronic instruments”, it’s this marvel of bass music combined with more classical interpretations of pop that make his music so engaging. Much like <strong>Gwilym Gold</strong>, perhaps his closest contemporary, the electronic explorations never clouds the song writing, it instead rides soberly and somberly on the back of the mournful and well chosen words.</p>\n<p><strong><em>“I’ve never been left alone, long enough, to be sure of where I’d go”</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>S O H</strong> N’s debut 12″, <em>The Wheel, </em>will be out November 5th via <strong>Aesop.</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F63481573&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18086-new-s-o-h-n-red-lines","category":"music","date":1350411114000,"wpid":18086,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":109,"src":"2012/10/sohn-165x109.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMH/8QAHBABAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQADAhEhMVGh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABP/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDI6ca81LLSvpRTyTeXTeIgS4//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284620140,"updatedAt":1588443772076,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/10/sohn-165x109.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
