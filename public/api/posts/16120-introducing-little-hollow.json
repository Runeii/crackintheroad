Having dipped a toe in the water under his premiere moniker (and real name) <strong>Logan Pate</strong>, <strong>Little Hollow</strong> appears to be a more considered musical affair.</p>\n<p>Slick, soulful vocals and a <strong>Youth Lagoon</strong>-esque level of emotional integrity make up the majority of the two tracks, leaving the listener unsure as to the musical direction of <strong>Little Hollow</strong>. Where previous work has seen<strong> <a href=\"https://loganpate.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pate</a></strong> construct delicate acoustic numbers that often spill over the five minute mark, it’s clear he’s aiming for a more refined aesthetic with this new project.
