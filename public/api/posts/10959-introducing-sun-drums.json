They weren’t called <strong>Sun Drums </strong>then, they were called <strong>Bagheera</strong>, but on first listens of the <strong><em>Sun Drums</em></strong> EP, released on October 1st via <a href=\"https://www.everybodysstalking.com/\">Everybody’s Stalking</a>, it appears that their general musical outlook has remained much the same. Which is definitely a good thing, because <strong>Bagheera </strong>were rad, and as it turns out, so are <strong>Sun Drums</strong>. Fans of the likes of <strong>Burial </strong>and <strong>Caribou</strong> will certainly find something to love among the EP’s five tracks, which do a fine job of melding<strong> William Bevan’s</strong> ghostly two-step with the more blissful, organic sounds that <strong>Dan Snaith</strong> is famous for, all served up with a distant, soulful falsetto and the occasional six-string. Expect a full review of <strong><em>Sun Drums </em></strong>closer to its release date, but in the meantime, you can stream and preorder the EP via the Everybody’s Stalking <a title=\"Everybody's Stalking Bandcamp\" href=\"https://everybodysstalking.bandcamp.com/track/leaves-along-the-stream\">bandcamp</a>, or listen to opening track <em>Leaves Along The Stream </em>here.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1321564434/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4492d5/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10959-introducing-sun-drums","category":"introducing","date":1315314462000,"wpid":10959,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/sundrums-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgf/xAAhEAACAgIDAAIDAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEESEABQYHIhITQf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAYEQEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAScf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ap3nKFTq/JSzS+fqtZrlRHKsTSq4OPt9jrWc71rg3svfWK/Y2oV6GswjldAwqyYOCRnWuUirI6/G9eVXYS/qrn8wd5wv94U7NmXsraqxCiVwADgAZPB5AmXKj017v/9k="},"createdAt":1587293918328,"updatedAt":1588403548865,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2011/09/sundrums-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
