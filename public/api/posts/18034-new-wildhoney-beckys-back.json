Taken from their first EP out on 20 October, this lead track is a promising sign of things to come.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1076747506/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18034-new-wildhoney-beckys-back","category":"music","date":1349729490000,"wpid":18034,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284647291,"updatedAt":1588441774672,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/4718399aaaf99cd57b77ed8881d91d05b8db0449.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
