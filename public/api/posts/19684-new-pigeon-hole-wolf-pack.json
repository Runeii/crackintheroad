You can stream ‘Wolf Pack’ below and, if the rest of the album consists of songs as good as this one, we’re all in for a treat when it drops.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=754177680/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19684-new-pigeon-hole-wolf-pack","category":"music","date":1360605812000,"wpid":19684,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283994603,"updatedAt":1588441770504,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"2013/02/pigeon+hole+pigeonhole-165x109.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
