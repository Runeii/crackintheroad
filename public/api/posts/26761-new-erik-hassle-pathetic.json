Its slightly refreshing to hear some music coming out of Sweden that blurs the line of alternative, electronic, pop and rock.</p>\n<p>With the release of Hassle’s EP coming March 4th I can’t help, but hope that Sohn has a hand in the rest of the tracks. There’s no denying they make a damn good team! Maybe bring Ellie back for a track to soften things up? Pleaes! Either way not complaining.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/134046095″ params=”color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"26761-new-erik-hassle-pathetic","category":"music","date":1392310094000,"wpid":26761,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":604,"height":336,"src":"2014/02/erikhassle_zps883a4c18.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAs0lEQVR4nCXOPQ6CMBgA0B6Ame8rUMCQCFGa+FMiizqoE0RNkJVYurFwCBI2zgATp+jhTPCd4JF1GG1ifkyS8+Vq2Y4JuI35bn+glk0tm6TpCRHDMAQAzrlStZRyHMcoikzTJK7r0oUQ4lOWtVJN08zzLIQwDIPAwvf9qqqyLJumqeu6vu+11kVREEQEAMZYEASe53HO8zxv21ZrPQwD+ReQWoDUdpjnr273h8Pc5+v9lfUPx9srrUadixAAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"createdAt":1587282425647,"updatedAt":1588403519258,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"2014/02/erikhassle_zps883a4c18.png","categories":["music","new"]}
