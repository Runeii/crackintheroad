It’s impossible to place or even draw comparisons to, and ends up coming across like a particularly nasty acid trip. All that said, it’s fucking brilliant. Towards the latter stages of<em> Trepanning</em>, there’s a vague <strong>Bloc Party</strong> feel to it, yet one hundred times more trippy. Experience <strong>Unmap</strong> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2417463697/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15175-new-unmap-trepanning","category":"mpfree","date":1329608008000,"wpid":15175,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292796823,"updatedAt":1588441781150,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2738d4d392e7b0768dd15e49a52.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
