You bet.</p><p></p>\n<p>Seattle’s <strong>NAVVI</strong> comprised of Kristin Henry and Brad Boettger already have the artwork nailed, and their two debut tracks show a huge amount of potential. Weekends is undoubtedly set to draw comparisons to the likes of <strong>London Grammar</strong> and<strong> Vaults</strong> yet with the addition of a cutting guitar line, whereas the ‘b-side’, <em>No Lights</em> threatens to break out into a Purity Ring inspired dance number, yet remains fairly within the confines of atmospheric, slightly quirky, electro-pop. Still early days, these two tracks are sure to garner a hive of interest, as much for the self-assured nature of release as for the actual quality, however I have no doubt that will come in time.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116326394\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116326169\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24691-introducing-navvi","category":"introducing","date":1382369328000,"wpid":24691,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/10/0001954065_20.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAL/xAAlEAACAQMDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABBEFBhIHURMUISIjMWH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Am96rJoe+9ZuI1eWy8tapxmdiseGXxOKD0zhmOfykXbxLcQRzRAGORQ6nuCMigzuwAXGtsBhmbBPf2im/s5i20dDLEkmxgJJP38a0H//Z"},"createdAt":1587282850424,"updatedAt":1588403525671,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/10/0001954065_20.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
