It’s dark, slightly foreboding and more than anything, it’s a real wake-up call to those artists that are perfectly content with simply allowing their sound to stagnate. Keep innovating.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76176130\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19966-new-keep-shelly-in-athens-madmen-love","category":"music","date":1361399225000,"wpid":19966,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283919293,"updatedAt":1588441770010,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/8c315722857d274b18abc6238b55b56fb06cd5ff.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
