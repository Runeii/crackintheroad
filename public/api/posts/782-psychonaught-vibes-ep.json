Gone is the Rn’B loops and excited melodies, in its place is an atmospheric and industrial trip for the senses. His early work doubtlessly had its place; however this new direction leaves the listener with a sensation far beyond the initial 15 minutes of music.<br />\nThe EP’s title record <em>‘Vibes’</em> is undoubtedly the star of the show; sparse yet thumping <strong>Psychonaught’s</strong> music seems to, almost out of nowhere, have a sound all of its own. But like his older music, the ability to blend party sounds with more atmospheric vibes still holds true. <em>‘Concrete Seat’</em> for example is a bouncy delight, thick with reverberating melodies and echoes. The EP’s final piece <em>‘Razor’</em> seems to take the blend of sounds heard in <em>‘Concrete Seat’</em> further; the melodies swarm like bright neon, the beats infectious to an extreme, Psychonaught has definitely progressed.</p>\n<p>What’s clear from <strong>Psychonaught’s</strong> <strong>Vibes EP</strong> is his ability to progress and revaluate his sound. The music is able to please a party crowd while still offering something textural and atmospheric for a keener listener.
