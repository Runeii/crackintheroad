And if you don’t like <strong>Bon Iver</strong> or <strong>Sigur Ros</strong>…well, I don’t have much to say to you at all.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWcyIpul8OE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10334-video-bon-iver-holocene-watch","category":"music","date":1313762385000,"wpid":10334,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/bon-iver-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwQI/8QAIxAAAgIBBAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABRIhBgciQUJRYf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIABAUREv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8ARNx8wqCbgDA001JJ0ryNyKrCoRyzccdgkfpyPYdm97NdnYjiQTnOs4+KpHTcOKOyq1mXkAcZ9WO9JNCWQ0a5MjkmNfkfrSaY2WBkvJNwqET/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294024733,"updatedAt":1588403550157,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2011/08/bon-iver-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
