Whether it’s with anthems like opening track The Embers, journeys through electronica on Mal à L’aise, or acoustic numbers like Alive and a Well, Infinite Worlds is incredibly expansive for a project that lasts less than half an hour. <em>Fear & Force</em> is a personal highlight. Opening with a beautiful finger picked guitar passage Lætitia sings of “hiding in the smallest spaces” creating a claustrophobic sonic environment. This is then relieved by the chorus’ warm bass and light harmonised vocals with lyrics speaking of returning to a more comfortable, familiar environment. It’s songwriting like this that comes across so easily and effectively that help make this such an unmissable debut. Check out  Fear & Force in the link below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMNH7KBye6s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33361-new-vagabon-fear-force","category":"music","date":1488294911000,"wpid":33361,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1440,"height":720,"src":"2017/02/vagabon_ebruyildiz_1440x720_header.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIBAAAQIFBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQFERMHEiFCYf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMxMv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Am661OYbOUiQD3Yom+O+54cQ0Bot4CVkea/VESLIez//Z"},"createdAt":1587279910578,"updatedAt":1588403502289,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"2017/02/vagabon_ebruyildiz_1440x720_header.jpg","categories":["music"]}
