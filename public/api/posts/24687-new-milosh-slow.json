Here Milosh lets his increasingly famous vocals stand almost entirely on their own, with just the faintest hint of piano to carry things along.</p>\n<p>It’s a sobering track and fans of Rhye will find it easy to slip in to Milosh’s sound, coming on almost like the cuddle that follows the passionate throes of Rhye.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/114924669″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"24687-new-milosh-slow","category":"music","date":1382351018000,"wpid":24687,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1392832,"height":709,"src":"2013/10/1392832_492297887535666_2048491078_n-950x709.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAIhAAAQMDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBAMFERITMQchIkGB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIVw6pXCfDp0JEGF4N07lJm28nJySRycED5n2sqb4HEl0Zpce5Os8oiD/9k="},"createdAt":1587282852302,"updatedAt":1588443766391,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"2013/10/1392832_492297887535666_2048491078_n-950x709.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
