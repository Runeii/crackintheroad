We know you’re a busy old lot, so we’ve taken the time to break down some of the biggest music videos from the past seven days for you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The xx – Say Something Loving</strong><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rh2uNrIgGf4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>As covered in <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/33348-man-vs-video-the-week-in-review-240217\" target=\"_blank\">the last edition Man vs. Video’s Week In Review</a>, nostalgia-porn is the go-to tool in the video maker’s arsenal. Is this any different? Nope. Old video games, VHS filters and 90s-style raves all feature, filling out that reminiscence checklist.</p>\n<p>It’s nice enough, I’m just never going to watch it again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Glass Animals – Pork Soda</strong><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8RkJhJcfOnc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One of the weirder Crufts applications I’ve seen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Weeknd – I Feel It Coming (Feat. Daft Punk)</strong><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFLhGq0060w\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>In the original Star Trek series, I always wondered how the crew could land on an alien planet and not have their insides violently eject their organs, or be crushed like a Panda Pop bottle by the increased gravity. I also found it strange that when Kirk would engage in coitus with a space lady he wouldn’t be incinerated in some kind of outer space breeding ritual.</p>\n<p>Now I think about it, I guess I’m not really talking about Star Trek at all. It’s more wishful thinking.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>KYLE – iSpy (Feat. Lil Yachty)</strong><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4is83n8xfLY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>If you don’t smile while watching this then… I don’t know. We can’t be friends. How about that? Who amongst us hasn’t wanted to live a magical life under the ocean or hates those sing-a-long videos where the words light up? Heathens. That’s who.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Foxygen – Upon a Hill</strong><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P3vUz2ehbDw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Ah, I get it, this whole thing is an exploration of what Scott Walker would sound like if he performed at children’s birthday parties.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Arianna Grande & John Legend – Beauty and the Beast</strong><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/axySrE0Kg6k\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>It’s miraculous how such an obviously expensive video can look so cheap. Aside from that? It’s dullness personified. It’s so boring it records catch-up episodes of Antiques Roadshow. It’s so inane it thinks Enya is club music. It’s so tedious it uses a piece of bread for a sandwich filling. It fucking sucks.</p>\n","slug":"33402-man-vs-video-the-week-in-review-10-03-17","category":"editorials","date":1489160831000,"wpid":33402,"isSticky":true,"featured_image":{"width":2522,"height":1344,"src":"2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-16.45.35.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAFCAIAAADzBuo/AAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAApklEQVR4nAGbAGT/ALGG0rWI27yetL2dw7B7n7iQsraP1LaOxraL17CG0wDClebGmfHTvbXMq9F8bGqsi7zWvcTOtLvCk/TBlOUAwZffv5zIxJ/bwZzkmk1StYK+y67SxaHYxaTHwJjRAMWhzNPAqsaY68iY6LZZc7+Evsie+Med5tPBpsOb1gC3k8G+n8a6iNC1gqewoqi6nL3DnOi9ltm7l8e1itWqQmkYHM/duAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="},"createdAt":1587279900475,"updatedAt":1588403501987,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-16.45.35.png","categories":["editorials","music","videos"]}
