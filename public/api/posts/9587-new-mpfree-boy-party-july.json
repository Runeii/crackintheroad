Gloriously lo-fi vocals and surf-pop guitars orchestrate the majority of <em>July</em>, whilst spoken word sections litter the track. It’s these short dialogues that provide a titillating contrast to the sections that are sung; and thus aid <em>July</em> on it’s way to be a track where further intricacies and inspired beauty formulate on repeated listens. <em>July</em> is taken from <strong><em>Who Cares?</em></strong> the first full length from<strong> Boy Party</strong>, out early September.
