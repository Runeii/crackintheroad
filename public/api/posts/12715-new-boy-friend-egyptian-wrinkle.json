There’s the shoegaze influenced vocals and the deep rooted sense of longing and lust, all tied up by the seductive vocals of <strong>Palozzolo</strong> and <strong>Brown’s</strong> omnipresent echoed guitar. Check out <em>Egyptian Wrinkle</em> below, and keep an ear out for their debut LP out next year on <a href=\"https://www.hellyes.it/news.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hell, Yes Records</a>.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28594251\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28594251\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/christapalazzolo/egyptian-wrinkle\">Egyptian Wrinkle</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/christapalazzolo\">Boy Friend</a></span></p>\n","slug":"12715-new-boy-friend-egyptian-wrinkle","category":"music","date":1321895405000,"wpid":12715,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293427829,"updatedAt":1588441785902,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273bb51097b4a1e6ccb919d6a70.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
