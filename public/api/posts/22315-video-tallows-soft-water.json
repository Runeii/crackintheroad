With a dozen or so dancers, accompanied by a song that’s as good as any you’ll hear this year, this is more than just a performance video; there’s a genuine connection between the band and the dancers. Check it out below, and keep your ears peeled for their debut LP, expected later this year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_SLo0e74I8o\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22315-video-tallows-soft-water","category":"music","date":1370280976000,"wpid":22315,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283431097,"updatedAt":1588441765934,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/266aa8fa1b8b2dfb8ae102b3905ff2729fb8494c.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
