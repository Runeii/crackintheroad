Steffaloo)","content":"<p><strong>Marcel Everett</strong> aka <strong>xxyyxx</strong> is blowing up at the moment, there’s no doubting that.</p><p> With a collaboration with<strong> Giraffage</strong> and <strong>REID</strong> on it’s way, it’s clear that 2012 is going to be his year. This new cut featuring the ever splendid vocals of <strong>Steph Thompson</strong>, otherwise known as <strong>Steffaloo</strong> sees <strong>Everett</strong> upping his game with a minimal, repetitive beat underpinned by the delicate, sparsely sampled vocals. If we ever needed confirmation of just how far both these artists have come in such a short space of time, then <em>Love Isn’t Made</em> may well just be it.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40671078&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15769-new-xxyyxx-love-isnt-made-feat-steffaloo","category":"music","date":1332514267000,"wpid":15769,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2012/03/278937_256840010996304_250879564925682_1150219_4861435_o-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAID/8QAJBAAAgEDAwMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDACExBRESBBMiI0FhkdH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG/8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDITH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AH6Wnei6UokryQAhQq8VbktzfIGN/mlGOcE+jL9R/tToDuYpt2axAF8Das5Hbm3kcn3o+2i2ClP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587292631858,"updatedAt":1588443774942,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/278937_256840010996304_250879564925682_1150219_4861435_o-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
