The first 30 seconds of the first track rolled by, and I instantly assumed I was listening to <a title=\"New: Oliver Tank – Dreams\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/12712-new-oliver-tank-dreams/\"><strong>Oliver Tank</strong>.</a> It seems the ‘Australian Wave’ has a clear style, enough at least, to be momentarily mistaken.</p>\n<p>My comparison to <strong>Tank</strong> is admittedly unfair and perhaps, more than anything, reveals an inherent need for my brain to put things in neat little boxes.<strong> Sungs</strong>’ music is actually quite different, taking the more conservative song writing arrangements of Tank’s music and laying it over hip-hop infused synth scapes. It’s awkward and convoluted at times, with the last 2 tracks of his new EP flailing about but never really finding the of soul of Tank or the groove of anyone else. Yet despite the EP’s shortcomings, there’s something special waiting to develop, listen to ‘<strong><em>All I think about (part 1</em></strong>)’ and tell me I’m wrong.</p>\n<p>Grab more music at Sung’s <a href=\"https://oscarkeysung.bandcamp.com/album/tape-voice-ep\">Bandcamp.</a></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1148413250/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"14658-introducing-oscar-key-sung","category":"introducing","date":1328564562000,"wpid":14658,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292932876,"updatedAt":1588441782648,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/38933b6cb36c1c064bb830125f2bc30e81508c5b.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
