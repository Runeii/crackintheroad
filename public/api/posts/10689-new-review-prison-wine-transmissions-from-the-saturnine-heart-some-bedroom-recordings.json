The searingly poignant <em>Twist The Knife</em>, featuring the chilling line ‘<em>why are you keeping me alive? Go ahead and twist the knife</em>‘, is emotionally cutting in the straightest sense of the word.</p>\n<p>There’s a stunning sense of honesty and youthful forgiveness found throughout <strong><em>Transmissions From…</em></strong> such as the plea for understanding that is <em>Help Me</em> (also the newest of the tracks) and the Americana inspired<em> Future Selves</em>. It’s somewhat perplexing as a release, with no tangible name or face to put to it, yet when the music is as engaging and expertly composed as <strong>Prison Wine’s</strong>, then the complete backstory is hardly needed.
