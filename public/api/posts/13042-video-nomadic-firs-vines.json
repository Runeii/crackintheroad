Made available earlier in the year via the <strong>Nomadic Firs</strong> <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nomadic-firs\" target=\"_blank\">soundcloud</a>, <em>Vines</em> is the most gloriously addictive three and a half minutes of psychedelic pop you’ll hear this year. Alongside the release of a video to accompany Vines, <strong>Nomadic Firs</strong> have also announced that their debut LP will be available via our long-time bros at <a href=\"https://crashsymbols.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Crash Symbols</strong></a>, which I’m sure you’ll agree is a match made in heaven.
