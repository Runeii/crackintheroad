The new single, <em>Flashes</em>, is a pop tune to the very core. It’s succinct, catchy and has an immersive narrative strapped to its sleeve. It’s actually rather menacing at times; the blissful pop sounds clashing sublimely with the grimly optimistic lyrics are an interesting slant on the formula.</p>\n<p>It also comes complete with a striking new video that could possibly point towards the inspiration for the piece. Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/26101889?title=0&portrait=0&color=ffffff\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/26101889\">Lama – Flashes</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/lavafilm\">Lavafilm</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n","slug":"9126-single-of-the-week-lama-flashes","category":"music","date":1310495069000,"wpid":9126,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/07/lama-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgL/xAAkEAACAQIFBAMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAFBhIhExRBYRWBsf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME/8QAGBEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIRAyH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AD8OnKmbKOvTQpv2lYmL7RcEKCR6/AcXT6U1VLTxSAZON6hrSTIrcjyCOD6wTzSrqfg55e4m6pPL7zc8Dz9nBtaiZlDNLIWIuSWNycFmtW0tReU//9k="},"createdAt":1587294222804,"updatedAt":1588403552966,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/07/lama-165x165.jpg","categories":["music"]}
