Anyway, my hatred of Mumford aside, this gem from French folk-pop troubadour<strong> Navacelle</strong> is well worthy of a listen.</p>\n<p>Penned as an ode to Sam, who is referenced numerous times throughout (<em>‘Was I, Sam, such a big jerk?’</em>), the confusion in translation combined with the unique accent makes it all the more adorable – <em>‘Near the fringe alone yelling, Not good for “elle”, leonine bell, My rose to oblivion, As flowers at your knees’</em>. It’s simple, yet highly effective, check out <em>My Rose To Oblivion</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=10462825/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://navacelle.bandcamp.com/track/my-rose-to-oblivion\">My Rose To Oblivion by Navacelle</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18019-new-navacelle-my-rose-to-oblivion","category":"mpfree","date":1349350021000,"wpid":18019,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284653729,"updatedAt":1587825886806,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
