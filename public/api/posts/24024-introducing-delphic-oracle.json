Take the a cappella track,<em> Death Dreams</em>, driven solely by the spine tingling vocals of <strong>Christiana Key</strong>; it’s both harrowing and utterly beautiful at the same time. The other track available so far,<em> Watching the Fern</em>, is equally as sinister, with Key’s foreboding vocals providing little room for glimpses of light to shine through, paired with shrieking violins. Don’t get me wrong, for as nightmarish as it is, it’s also brilliant, and an extremely promising indicator of what’s to come on the full EP, out 4 September.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2883974669/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24024-introducing-delphic-oracle","category":"music","date":1377888368000,"wpid":24024,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283041318,"updatedAt":1587825864823,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","new"]}
