By Diplo)","content":"<p>I’m still to be convinced by<strong> Azealia Banks</strong>.</p><p> Sure, I find her music rather interesting, but not to the point of me actually wanting to relisten; it’s just an experience that gets tiresome rather quickly. New track, <em>Fuck Up The Fun</em> produced by none other than <strong>Diplo</strong> is supposedly a diss towards <strong>Iggy</strong> and <strong>T.I.</strong> yet as far as put downs go, it’s fairly weak. There’s plenty of <strong>Azealia’s</strong> stereotypical highly offensive spouting, however, to be honest, it’s getting monotonous; come on <strong>Azealia</strong>, we know you’re better than this. At least it has a good beat, right?</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40916157&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15813-new-azealia-banks-fuck-up-the-fun-prod-by-diplo","category":"mpfree","date":1332703565000,"wpid":15813,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":90,"src":"2012/03/azealia-banks-165x90.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAHxAAAgEDBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRBQYSITEj/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMDb2hXbaUNxz3MS2csrQR2qBiW+JcBvAoHBuxk5OPKhkVGdiEQAkkDjSlB//9k="},"createdAt":1587292621123,"updatedAt":1588443774862,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/azealia-banks-165x90.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
