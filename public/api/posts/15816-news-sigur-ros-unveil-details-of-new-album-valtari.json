In a good way,”.</em></p>\n<p>Lead singer <strong>Jonsi</strong> also revealed that as with the majority of their previous releases, <em><strong>Valtari</strong></em> will contain no English lyrics whatsoever, despite their brief experimentation on <strong><em>Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust</em></strong> and on his own solo project. A work in progress tracklisting has also been released (see below) as well as a host of tour dates. As previously confirmed,<strong> Bestival</strong> will be their only UK festival appearance of 2012.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Valtari (Not complete tracklisting)</em></strong><br />\nÉg Anda<br />\nEkki Múkk<br />\nVarúð<br />\nRembihnútur<br />\nDauðalogn<br />\nVarðeldur<br />\nValtari</p>\n<p><strong>Sigur Rós 2012 Tour Dates:</strong><br />\n08/03 – Montreal, QC, Osheaga Festival<br />\n08/18-19 – Osaka and Tokyo, JP, Summer Sonic<br />\n08/24 – Paris, FR, Rock en Seine<br />\n08/25 – Winterthur, CH, Steinberggasse<br />\n08/28 – Amsterdam, NL, Paradiso<br />\n08/29 – Amsterdam, NL, Paradiso<br />\n08/31 – Stradbally, IE, Electric Picnic<br />\n09/04 – Vienna, AT, Arena<br />\n09/05 – Ljublhana, SL, Krizanke<br />\n09/07 – Berlin, DE, Berlin Festival<br />\n09/09 – Isle of Wight, UK, Bestival<br />\n09/16 – Krakow, PL, Sacrum Profanum<br />\n09/17 – Krakow, PL, Sacrum Profanum</p>\n","slug":"15816-news-sigur-ros-unveil-details-of-new-album-valtari","category":"music","date":1332704746000,"wpid":15816,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":127,"src":"2012/03/sigur_ros-165x127.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAeEAEAAgIDAAMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAURFAYhQf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQJB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCYcZo/HOX0uV88Y0mpTURsuUFAjKT1+r99ZMN3zw3L411hAskRBXo7xjDKDLw//9k="},"createdAt":1587292619881,"updatedAt":1588443774841,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/sigur_ros-165x127.jpg","categories":["music","news"]}
