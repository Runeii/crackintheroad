Full of dusty claps and thick and jaded wastelands, the record has a sleazy grove throughout that makes for something rather distinct if not altogether emotionally engaging.</p>\n<p>The EP drops via The Trilogy Tapes this March.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3854252\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20016-new-anthony-naples-el-portal-ep","category":"newmixtapes","date":1361456792000,"wpid":20016,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283903460,"updatedAt":1588441769853,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/042d0691f48389363994f5a3e671d7d24ddc6c86.jpg","categories":["newmixtapes","stream","new","music","newnews"]}
