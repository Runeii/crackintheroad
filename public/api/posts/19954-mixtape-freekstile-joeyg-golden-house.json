A number of the backing tracks, while influenced by Golden Age Hip-Hop, cut their own path with some inventive flourishes, ‘F1Humanauts’ being a fine example of this. The chords that provide the backdrop of the track are reminiscent of the of kind of progressions Nas favoured on <em>Illmatic, </em>but the fidgety drums and quick stabs of bass mark it out as something substantially more modern.</p>\n<p>Both barsmiths display proficient lyricism, but it is Freekstile who possesses the greater skill behind the mic. He does nothing particularly revolutionary but, to paraphrase <em>Men In Black, </em>he makes it sound good. I also thoroughly enjoyed the references that are dropped throughout <em>Golden House.</em> Alongside the rap tropes of money and $WAG, Freekstile & JoeyG explore the less generic topics of video games, TV shows and movies, with the <em>Dexter</em> and Gandalf<em> </em>references on ‘2Jedi’ and ‘Das Flow’ respectively being some of my favourites. There is also a surprising amount of remarks regarding Greek Mythology throughout <em>Golden House</em>, which can only be a good thing.</p>\n<p>Like pretty much every mixtape, there are some weak moments on <em>Golden House</em>, but, honestly, this is one of the joys of the form and the positive merits of the album far outweigh the missteps. <em>Golden House</em> is available for free download, so you should download it for free and bump your head… enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>Highlights: ‘F1Humanauts’, ‘2Jedi’, ‘Kurosai’, ‘Das Flow’, ‘Sour Kreme’ and ‘That Man’.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=60165873/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=7d0bea/\" height=\"410\" width=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19954-mixtape-freekstile-joeyg-golden-house","category":"newmixtapes","date":1361384840000,"wpid":19954,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283921138,"updatedAt":1587825877990,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","categories":["newmixtapes","new","mixtapes","music","newnews"]}
