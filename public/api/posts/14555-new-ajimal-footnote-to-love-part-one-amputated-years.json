The same walkman carrying, beret wearing, new music junkies who initially branded <strong>Bon Iver</strong> the new Nick Drake, are now choosing to compare <strong>Vernon</strong> to a lesser <strong>Phil Collins</strong>; a fairly stark change of heart.</p>\n<p>One such artist who finds the pop-folk balance in a gracious and thoroughly engrossing manner is Newcastle troubadour <strong>Ajimal</strong>, the moniker of <strong>Fran O’Hanlon</strong>. With a concoction of influences so spotless that Walter White himself would envy it’s make up, <strong>O’Hanlon’s</strong> latest single <em>Footnote To Love [Part One]</em> is a stunning culmination of his life journey to date. Impeccable vocals float wonderfully over a amiably strummed acoustic guitar, at times threatening to open out into a broad, expansive number, yet remaining modestly self-knowing, entrusting itself into <strong>O’Hanlon’s</strong> nigh on perfect delivery and deeply personal lyrics.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F34830772&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p>As <em>Footnote To Love [Part One]</em> demands repeated listens due to it’s sheer beauteous atmosphere, B-side Amputated Years pleads despairingly with the listener to be experienced again. A more subdued number, but no less effective, <em>Amputated Years</em> is worthy of a single release in it’s own right, not so much striking a nerve as cutting directly to the core. <em>‘Oh and how we’ve changed, how we’ve changed my love’</em> weeps <strong>O’Hanlon</strong> in a reassuringly disconsolate fashion, displaying his music as all too human, yet bewitchingly supernatural.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F34831770&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Footnote To Love [Part One] / Amputated Years</em> is released 19 March via <strong>Pop Sex Ltd</strong>, <a href=\"https://ajimal.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">purchase it here</a>.</p>\n","slug":"14555-new-ajimal-footnote-to-love-part-one-amputated-years","category":"music","date":1328202303000,"wpid":14555,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292955082,"updatedAt":1588441782913,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/027e439a714e044125cf2e7db372d2449ce02881.jpg","categories":["music","new","reviews"]}
