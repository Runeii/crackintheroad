With a couple of covers and a handful of original tracks now kicking about online, it’s becoming clear that the Manchester outfit are big fans of the crooners, not only that but with as with WU LYF, there’s a real attempt to craft a narrative, in both the music and the creative approach. Check out their version of <em>Don’t Break My Heart</em>, filmed live at Manchester Art Gallery.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TdGw8ROBfwk\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22611-video-menage-a-trois-dont-break-my-heart-ub40-cover-live-manchester-art-gallery","category":"music","date":1371653719000,"wpid":22611,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283374077,"updatedAt":1588441765205,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/21267fcf6c89656a2da81632dc4838f2bb504d10.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
