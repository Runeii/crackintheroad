Well it’s a pretty emotionally desolate song to be honest; any piece of music that finishes with the line <em>‘I don’t want to die’</em> is sure to be fairly hard-hitting.</p><p> This first track from North American duo <strong>Pacific Empire</strong> is a bleak yet beautiful piece of work from Spokane musician <strong>Cameron Gorman</strong> and Montreal’s <strong>Velvet Glacier</strong>, aka<strong> Rémi Boudrias-Dussault</strong>.<em> Death Song</em> is the first track produced by this collaboration, and sets a melancholic tone, keeping instrumental sections to an ambient minimum and relying upon the sharp vocals to guide the track. Mixing lo-fi recording methods with shoegaze inspired effects, it’s despairing honest and wholly endearing. Downbeat and depressing it may be, but boy is it magnificent.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3856277045/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10674-new-pacific-empire-death-song","category":"music","date":1314456443000,"wpid":10674,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":350,"height":350,"src":"2011/08/3342984356-1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQGB//EACEQAAMAAAUFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAEBREhBgcSIzFx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEiH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALDVu4WmaO0p5+4i1F8lOzEbfowT63y9ZrSbo03AZWBbkH4fmMc1T3ZSYt7Bzw/OEI3qkZqtaKoUAAMQANsDi2X/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293974835,"updatedAt":1588403549470,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/08/3342984356-1.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
