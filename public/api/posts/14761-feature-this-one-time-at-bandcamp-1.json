From pictures of 90’s footballers on the cross, to self described melodic doom metal, I’ve seen it all, and it’s made me a changed man. Whilst many of the gems end up on the pages of CitR, I often wonder, what happens to the (sometimes unintentional) genius of the other works? Having pondered that thought for a while, I decided to start a weekly feature, hilariously titled <strong>This One Time At Bandcamp</strong>, picking out some of the, how shall I put it, more unique bandcamp releases.</p>\n<p><strong>The Macken Mouse</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/14761-feature-this-one-time-at-bandcamp-1/attachment/2465830992-1-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14774\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14774\" title=\"Mackem Mouse\" src=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2012/02/2465830992-11-260x260.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" /></a></p>\n<p>Being a Newcastle United fan, I had an issue with this before I’d even clicked on it.
