She has been showcasing new material live for the first time from her new album, <em>I Speak Before I Can</em>, as well as throwing in a <a href=\"https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/laura-marling/2010/the-lowry-manchester-england-4bd48746.html\" target=\"_blank\">couple of old songs and a Neil Young cover</a>. But this isn’t the only reason to check out her latest shows. Support not only comes from singer-songwriter <strong>Alessi’s Ark</strong>, but also Australian folk outfit <strong>Boy & Bear</strong>.</p>\n<p>The four members of <strong>Boy & Bear</strong> all fronted various musical acts before coming together to form the current band last year. From experimental music to singer-songwriters, the band members have found their natural balancing point in their three part harmonies of Americana folk. Because of this, it is almost too obvious to draw the parallels with <strong>Fleet Foxes</strong>, yet, due to their vast array of influences, they still manage to sound fresh and exciting – a feat which few new bands achieve nowadays.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?3t5jyaidwlx\" target=\"_blank\">Mexican Mavis</a></p>\n","slug":"252-boy-bear","category":"music","date":1271232353000,"wpid":252,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":720,"height":441,"src":"2010/04/boybear.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIBAAAQMEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhESQRMxMv/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAGhEAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxETMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Az63ZXaGbZDjyLfKdWEueR3mnfJBHyPWtnupp/KbOp5xQizQConW0HulKO5J7kpmvsXADP//Z"},"createdAt":1587295358897,"updatedAt":1588403569044,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d14","old_image":"2010/04/boybear.jpg","categories":["music"]}
