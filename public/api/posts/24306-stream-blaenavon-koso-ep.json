Whilst they’re beginning to shake the ‘bedroom recordings’ feel to their output, there’s still an immediate intimacy to their music that’s strangely refreshing. EP opener<em> Gods</em> is a reworked version of an old demo, now bolder and ready for the live circuit, whereas blog favourites <em>Wunderkind</em> and<em> Prague</em> have received comparisons to everyone from Wild Beasts, to The Maccabees to Coldplay (…?).
