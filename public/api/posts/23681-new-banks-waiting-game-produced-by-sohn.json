With the deep, rolling synth sections, and sampled vocals that dominate much of <strong>SOHN’s</strong> own work, it’s far and away her finest track to date. It’s bold, delicately poignant, and effortlessly slick. A host of tour dates coming up with The Weeknd, and rumours of numerous other collaborations in the works, <em>Waiting Game</em> is just the start of a very exciting few months for <strong>BANKS</strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104054925\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23681-new-banks-waiting-game-produced-by-sohn","category":"music","date":1375713962000,"wpid":23681,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":784,"height":520,"src":"2013/08/b31-784x520.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIG/8QAIxAAAQMDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEQYhBxUiIzEyUv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDOX3V4smk7RGgokRn3HUSA/FeCehCwVJ9QckHGNx5q5nFOFImPv8hf7jil7yEZ3OfilKD/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283146622,"updatedAt":1588403528053,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/b31-784x520.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
