Moving across the millennium its injection into genres like dubstep and breaks has once again taken music in a brave new direction. However despite its lengthy history, one of the last remaining British touring systems is the Leeds based <strong>IRATION STEPPAS SOUNDSYSTEM</strong>.</p>\n<p>On the second of May they blessed Newcastle’s <strong>Deviate</strong> with their mix of roots reggae and high pressured dub. <strong>Iration Steppas</strong> create a brand of dub which seems like it was made for the sole purpose of being played over their own system; with methodical melodies accompanied by warm but bone shattering bass lines underneath.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Iration</strong> was <strong>Punch Drunk’s RSD</strong>, their music epitomising the more ‘dub influenced’ side of dubstep. Coming on at about 1 after Iration Steppas had steadily warmed the packed crowd; <strong>RSD</strong> smashed it. Pushing the tempo up and dropping <strong>Congo Natty’s</strong><em> ‘Code Red’</em>, a particularly special moment given how rare Jungle seems to be in Newcastle. <strong>Iration</strong> finished off the night in style, eventually setting fire to one of their right bass bins! It was certainly a night no one will forget.</p>\n<p>Written by Jack Tomson</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QZMJX_RA0M\">Watch a Short Film From The Night</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/irationsteppas\">Check Their Myspace</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/jackpearcefilm\">Watch More of Jack Pearce’s Films</a></p>\n","slug":"744-iration-steppas","category":"music","date":1273503850000,"wpid":744,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":451,"src":"2010/05/iration.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcI/8QAIhAAAgEDAwUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRBQcSBhMUITFS/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM76DqTaJdC5sSPIj5KHcEqRj81TbTdPo2G1hin2/gnlRFV5TKi9xgMFscPWfuKUoP/Z"},"createdAt":1587295286450,"updatedAt":1588403568030,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2010/05/iration.jpg","categories":["music"]}
