Reverb heavy guitar lines, echo laden vocals and an intangible sense of awareness contribute to one of the finest new tracks of 2013 thus far. Gorgeous layered vocal melodies and an almost Nick Cave sense of unspoiled existentialism, there’s no describing simply how unexpectedly moving this track is.
