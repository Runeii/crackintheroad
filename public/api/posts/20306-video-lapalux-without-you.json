Album cut, <em>Without You</em>, now has a video, a stomach churning mournful story of a doomed relationship, thanks mostly to the fact that one of the pair is permanently dressed in a gimp suit. Rather than taking it off he chooses to star in this music video, which I can only assume is inspired by//is real events. He should just take it off.</p>\n<p>Taken from <strong>Lapalux</strong>‘s debut album ‘<em>Nostalchic</em>‘ – released 26 March worldwide on Brainfeeder.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkWWJ9W5300\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20306-video-lapalux-without-you","category":"music","date":1362643651000,"wpid":20306,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283807281,"updatedAt":1588441768917,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/a34db2c0f63a0c806d612e8997a1ad42cd9d20c4.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews","videos"]}
