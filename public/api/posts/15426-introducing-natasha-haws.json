This is probably partially the reason that it took me so long to happen across the scintillatingly beautiful music of North East songstress <strong>Natasha Haws</strong>. Alright… maybe songstress is slightly a too strong word to use, give her tender years and relative youthful inexperience, however I have no doubt that with the right guidance and perseverance, she’ll blossom into a performer truly worthy of such an illustrious title.</p>\n<p>Having heard much about <strong>Natasha’s</strong> music, I went against all the rules of music blogging, and actually listened to the hype, and boy was it worth it. Her most recent track, the fragile <em>Stepping Stone</em> displays an almost unfathomable level of maturity, as she twists her words with a heartbreaking elegance. The vocals are distinct and verging upon haunting, not so much striking a nerve as mercilessly ripping it from your undeserving body, whilst remaining utterly admirable throughout.
