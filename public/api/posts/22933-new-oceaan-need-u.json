Choppy beats and the stunning, versatile vocal merge flawlessly, forming what is one of the years finest tracks. It’s early days, but<strong> Oceaán</strong> is perhaps the most exciting young British producer to have emerged since a certain Jai Paul. Check out<em> Neéd U</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F99202979\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22933-new-oceaan-need-u","category":"music","date":1373381087000,"wpid":22933,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":635,"src":"2013/07/1000087_537944846253172_547572924_n-950x635.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEE/8QAIBAAAgEEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABIhMQURIlGSof/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMG/8QAGBEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABESP/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJxMs0d9hklWSNS7mUqR4PQYOwM6+VtZYyxLzvcTnuO/WlKk2uigKsBuf//Z"},"createdAt":1587283300592,"updatedAt":1588443768456,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/07/1000087_537944846253172_547572924_n-950x635.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
