{"id":"5e9c01a4774c2610387e47c6","title":"ARTIST PROFILE: Andrew Khosravani","content":"<p>Peckham-based illustrator <strong>Andrew Khosravani</strong> conjures up new lands and creatures  with free-flowing psychedelic lines.</p><p> Inspired by science fiction, dead civilisations and jungles it is easy to see how these areas come into play in his creations, which often include tikki-gods combined with writhing plant life or un-quenchable seas. Alternatively Andrew loves drawing blues musicians in response to their music. With commissions from <strong>Dazed and Confused</strong>, <strong>Little White Lies</strong> and <strong>MTV</strong> under his belt things are looking good. Nonetheless he feels his involvement in the <strong>Wu Tang Exhibition</strong>, opening on the 6<sup>th</sup> of March, might just be his peak, but we don’t believe him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2014/03/1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27165\" alt=\"1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n.jpg 960w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n-150x150.jpg 150w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n-600x600.jpg 600w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n-100x100.jpg 100w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1795494_541465245968349_1199759299_n-50x50.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>What made you get into drawing?</strong></p>\n<p>I only really started to push it after I saw my friend <a href=\"https://georgeheavenillustration.blogspot.co.uk\">George</a>‘s work. We were probably 14 at the time and he was always drawing these hilarious little cartoons that were so much more advanced than anything I had done.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you love about it?</strong></p>\n<p>Drawing is great because you can spend days labouring away on one drawing and then you look up at the guy next to you, who spent 5 minutes on something and it looks way better than your thing. This sounds like a negative thing but I love it because it reminds me how many different possibilities are out there in making an image and to constantly try new things. I also love animation, which is even more depressingly time consuming, but I like making shit move.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/whales-and-shit-7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27173\" alt=\"whales and shit 7\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/whales-and-shit-7.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"906\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/whales-and-shit-7.jpg 670w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/whales-and-shit-7-222x300.jpg 222w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/whales-and-shit-7-37x50.jpg 37w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about a place which inspires you?</strong></p>\n<p>I recently got back from Sao Paulo in Brazil, and that place is mental. My Mum is from there so I was out there visiting family but it’s by far the craziest city I have ever been too. Its so big and dense it makes London look like the Shire but its also so colourful it almost hurts your eyes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1012038_528260927288781_1698980397_n.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27170\" alt=\"1012038_528260927288781_1698980397_n\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1012038_528260927288781_1698980397_n.jpg\" width=\"420\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1012038_528260927288781_1698980397_n.jpg 420w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1012038_528260927288781_1698980397_n-131x300.jpg 131w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/1012038_528260927288781_1698980397_n-22x50.jpg 22w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Other interests and inspirations?</strong></p>\n<p>When I was younger I read J.G Ballard’s ‘The Atrocity Exhibition’, which really inspired me. He writes like a surgeon and this book is full of surreal and visceral imagery. It’s a really bizarre book because if you were to ask what it’s about, I honestly wouldn’t be able to tell you, but the imagery he conjures up is incredible. I also skate which manages to distract me more than anything, but it’s a source of constant inspiration. Last night I went to Jacob Ovgren’s exhibition who does a lot of the graphics for Polar Skateboards. It’s a rad show, with really great work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/strip_4_1000.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27171\" alt=\"strip_4_1000\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/strip_4_1000.jpg\" width=\"837\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/strip_4_1000.jpg 837w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/strip_4_1000-300x129.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/strip_4_1000-50x22.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Is there a narrative or specific concept behind your work?</strong></p>\n<p>It depends on the project, sometimes there is a clear narrative that I’m using to link images together and sometimes it just a bit of fun and it can make less sense. I have always been interested in interlinking images and creating fluidity in my work so I almost always have a reasoning behind everything (even if I’m the only one that understands the reason).</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what you’ve been working on recently and any upcoming projects.</strong></p>\n<p>I have been working on a couple of animations with a couple of very talented illustrator/animators. One with <a href=\"www.maciekjanicki.com\">Maciek Janicki</a> and another with Cristina<a href=\"https://cristinafloritgomila.com\"> Florit Gomila</a> I’m really looking forward to them being finished hopefully by summer time. I also did some board graphics for Slam City Skates, which I’m excited about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/New-Slam-Boards-for-email-copy_1000.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27169\" alt=\"New Slam Boards for email copy_1000\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/New-Slam-Boards-for-email-copy_1000.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"783\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/New-Slam-Boards-for-email-copy_1000.jpg 800w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/New-Slam-Boards-for-email-copy_1000-300x294.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/New-Slam-Boards-for-email-copy_1000-50x50.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewkhosravani.com/\">https://andrewkhosravani.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wutangisforthechildren.co.uk\">https://wutangisforthechildren.co.uk</a></p>\n","slug":"27162-artist-profile-andrew-khosravani","category":"arts","date":1395163840000,"wpid":27162,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":720,"src":"2014/03/1888692_545600882221452_1275717999_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAIxAAAgEEAAYDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAMRIQUHEhMiI0Fxkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAED/8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A3ZvE0hsJMl5Cx/Y1pwdtc7jKqnQPVhcj5/KjH5qy2j2jcmOHKgsDAtvvG/LIz94FKUQpbX//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282340955,"updatedAt":1588403517684,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d2e","old_image":"2014/03/1888692_545600882221452_1275717999_n.jpg","categories":["arts"]}
