We’ll get the <strong>Bon Iver</strong> references out of the way now, however it’s entirely unavoidable; nowadays seemingly any male who plucks a guitar is heralded as a direct descendent so don’t be too distracted. The duel vocals combine in a way that seeks to recount multiple stories, interlocking and overlapping throughout their duration.
