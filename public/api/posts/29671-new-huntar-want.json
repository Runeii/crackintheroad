The beautifully atmospheric All That I Want is the closest he’s come to a ballad so far, combining the emotional maturity of SOHN and James Blake, with the slick production recently associated with rising stars Oceaán and Ben Khan. Judging by the strength of these three tracks so far, and with a debut EP on the horizon, the future of HUNTAR is beginning to look mightily exciting.
