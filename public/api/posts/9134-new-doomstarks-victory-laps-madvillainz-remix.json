Their label, <strong>Nature Sounds</strong>, have been tweeting recently that news, or at the very least a solid announcement, were just around the corner. For some people it got even more exciting. Certain people who bought the ‘<em>DOOM x Akomplice box</em>’ were mailed a limited tape recently, featuring a remix of the album track ‘<em>victory laps</em>’.</p>\n<p>Although not strictly an album track, the recording gives us an exciting insight into what the LP could be like. In many ways it’s what was expected; <strong>DOOM</strong>’s surreal streams of consciousness combined with <strong>Ghost</strong>’s more reality driven witticisms. But just to make one thing clear though: I am not complaining.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18812352\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18812352\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/djseptember7th/doomstarks-victory-laps-2dope\">DOOMSTARKS (DOOM x Ghostface Killah) – Victory Laps (Madvillainz Remix) [Radio Rip]</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/djseptember7th\">Dj September 7th</a></span> </p>\n","slug":"9134-new-doomstarks-victory-laps-madvillainz-remix","category":"music","date":1310503872000,"wpid":9134,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/07/doomstarks-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgcI/8QAIhAAAgICAQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBAURAAYSIRQjUVKS/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAb/xAAbEQABBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDEQQxYf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Am2M6ryjHQU63db3SGmTZMHRPxvXjjFWN6nYqExeukSAPhh1wpSro9bX9lf5HNNYh7Y4mkItmAEQAAkfqOHjAftVcjhjtsi76v//Z"},"createdAt":1587294220058,"updatedAt":1588403552911,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/07/doomstarks-165x165.jpg","categories":["music"]}
