(If it can work for Kaiser Chiefs, it can work for anyone).</p><p> Well that’s precisely what <strong>Peace</strong> have done, with ‘new’ single<em> Follow Baby</em> premiering on<strong> Zane Lowe’s</strong> show earlier this evening, alongside announcing details of their debut album In Love, out 25 March. So it’s better than I remembering it being the first time around, even if the opening riff is still somewhere between Radiohead and My Bloody Valentine, with the laddish snarl of Kasabian. Heck, maybe I’m starting to like it.
