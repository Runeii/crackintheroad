These two new tracks from <strong>Marika Hackman</strong>, lifted from her forthcoming EP <strong><em>Deaf Heat</em></strong>, definitely feel more detached from her previous output, and that of her contemporaries, with that being meant in the finest sense possible. Utilising her impeccable vocals, as with the rest of the EP, it almost feels part of a live experience, transferred onto record, and will no doubt translate fantastically well to stage. Check out both <em>Call Off The Dogs</em> and <em>Deep Green below</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140178211&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137168586&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27501-new-marika-hackman-call-dogs-deep-green","category":"music","date":1395422468000,"wpid":27501,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282332831,"updatedAt":1588441759982,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/41077d9cd0918d198945fa02438dc329c8bdd212.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
