Their new track, <em>Wonderkind</em>, may well be their most accomplished work to date, glittering synths sections merge effortlessly with the sweeping violin accompaniment. Despite having yet to grace the live stage, you can be sure that when they do, with tracks like this, they’re destined to impress.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F91487703\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22526-new-lovelier-other-wonderkind","category":"music","date":1371229707000,"wpid":22526,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283393791,"updatedAt":1588441765505,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2731a2bd47d75bb2b22d8332e2d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
