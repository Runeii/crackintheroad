Exploding onto these pages with their fantastic <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/19782-new-prehistoric-forest-the-dark-ages/\" target=\"_blank\">debut single</a> back in February, the quintet returned with the slower paced <em>Your Move</em> midway through June, and have now followed that up with the absolutely brilliant <em>Good Time</em>. As with<em> The Dark Ages</em>, it’s another slice of early <strong>Strokes</strong> inspired rock and roll. Check out both <em>Good Time</em> and <em>Your Move</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 527px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1012016749/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 527px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3538115165/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24054-new-prehistoric-forest-good-time","category":"mpfree","date":1378055980000,"wpid":24054,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283031357,"updatedAt":1588441762944,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273f51c1df557143cd771a4e0a3.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
