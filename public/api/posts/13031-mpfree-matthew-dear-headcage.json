Channelling a lovely meld of Byrne/Bowie/Gabriel (just a few that spring to mind), sprinklings of Prince, and a techno framework (boiled down further with his <strong>Audion</strong> side project), he really has a bigger personality than most musicians and really deserves more credit for his sheer creativity.</p>\n<p>He seems to fill a void that we didn’t know was there. And he does a great job of showing his contemporaries up over recent years. To give you an idea of the kind of diverse electronic styles this man is interested in I’ll give you a snippet of his label roster: <strong>Dabrye</strong>, <strong>Tycho</strong>, <strong>Gold Panda</strong>, and <strong>Com Truise</strong>. And If you’re embarrassed to not have engorged yourself on <em>Black City</em>, I’d try and keep an eye out for his upcoming release, <em>Beams</em>. This track is just a tease of what’s to come – it’s the title track of a new EP out in January – but after that what we can probably expect is a hugely ambitious pop album, considering his track record. Enjoy.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to and download Headcage below.</em></p>\n<p><center><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29810151&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29810151&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object></center></p>\n","slug":"13031-mpfree-matthew-dear-headcage","category":"mpfree","date":1323384818000,"wpid":13031,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293293465,"updatedAt":1588441785215,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/04afe9f4caeaf93c29893cc37de2ddbe71c2c874.jpg","categories":["mpfree","music"]}
