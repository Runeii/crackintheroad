The songs are tight and intricately arranged cuts of folky Americana, with a very Californian pop sheen, and there are some lovely melodic duets from the two vocalists, Scott Peterson and Marlaina Rae, especially on tracks <i>This Is What We Know </i>and <i>Golden Sands. </i>Aside from energetic and surprisingly uplifting opener <i>Summer Dies, </i>standout track <i>White Calm </i>makes the seasonal transition feel nicely seamless,<i> </i>with its Christmas-sy bells and rousing chorus sounding equally suited to windows-down driving in the sunshine and walking through the snow. <b>Sea Dramas </b>are a good band to be listening to when you have absolutely no idea what the weather’s going to be like tomorrow.</p>\n<p>The album is for sale on <b>Sea Dramas<i> </i></b>bandcamp – preview it below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2791094220/size=grande/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><code><a href=\"https://seadramas.bandcamp.com/album/soft-wake\">Soft Wake by Sea Dramas</a><br />\n</code></p>\n","slug":"20356-introducing-sea-dramas","category":"introducing","date":1362838323000,"wpid":20356,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283787060,"updatedAt":1587825876257,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d1a","categories":["introducing","music"]}
