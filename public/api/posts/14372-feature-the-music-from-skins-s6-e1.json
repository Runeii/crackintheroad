{"id":"5e9c2b539b6559241525d559","title":"Feature: The Music From Skins (S6, E1)","content":"<p>Love it or hate it, Skins is back on our TV sets.</p><p> So it’s hugely cliched, overly offensive and features some of the worst acting ever seen, but I can’t help having a soft spot for it. Earlier this evening the first episode of series six of the BAFTA award winning drama was premiered on E4, so with CitR being a music website, it makes sense to look back upon the musical offerings used in the show.</p>\n<p>Opening moped scene – <strong>Azealia Banks</strong> – <em>212 (Feat. Lazy Jay)</em></p>\n<p>The most hyped track of the past few months was inevitably going to appear on the show at some point, but including it in the opening credits was a bold move. Did it work? Well yeah, just about.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"35\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3Jv9fNPjgk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>On the drive to the villa – <strong>The War On Drugs</strong> – <em>Baby Missiles</em></p>\n<p>A modern day classic and perfectly fitting to the jovial mood of the scene, an inspired choice.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"35\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMToQg0vSds\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Lounging by the pool – <strong>Hanni El Khatib</strong> – <em>Build. Destroy. Rebuild.</em></p>\n<p>Another good choice, although could have used slightly more of the track.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"35\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8zeabLPHYo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Matty and Frankie arrive – <strong>The Smiths</strong> – <em>How Soon Is Now?</em></p>\n<p>So it appears that Joey Barton has made <strong>The Smiths</strong> cooler than ever, however including How Soon Is Now? wasn’t the best move, and was only made worse by the horrendous<strong> Morrissey</strong> name-drop later in the script.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"35\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUMh8GQnDW8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The boys have a shower – <strong>H-Kayne</strong> – <em>Issawa Style</em></p>\n<p>Soundtracking the ‘funny’ moments is never easy, but this inclusion of a relatively obscure Moroccan rap hit was another fine pick.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"35\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8TRhCRUvjR0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Rich and Grace on the roof – <strong>King Creosote & Jon Hopkins</strong> – <em>Your Own Spell</em></p>\n<p>The highlight from one of last years most underrated records, this track deserved a far more poignant moment, not helped by the rigid acting.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"35\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/quwJvKT8HWc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Grace sings – <strong>Francoise Hardy</strong> – <em>All Because Of You (performed by Jessica Sula)</em></p>\n<p>A fantastic song unfortunately ruined by a fairly average cover.
