It’s in your face, it’s immediate, and it’s all the better for it. Debut track <em>Visiting Myself In Hospital</em> is an angularly composed journey through a plethora of both modern and classic influences; ranging from almost psychedelic 70’s vibes, to far smoother, chorus driven artists, not too far from those packing out stadiums around the world.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118815622\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>New outing, Catharsis comes across like a more coherent, and fully realised Guillemots, toying with the sort of riffs that dominated Foals’ Antidotes, even swaying dramatically into the dreaded ‘folk’ territory. There’s no half measures for <strong>Bleeding Heart Pigeons</strong>, with Catharsis tipping the seven and a half minute mark, diverting course throughout, showing more versatility in one track than many artists do during their whole career, and ultimately making for one of the most daring and immersive tracks of the year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/121212553%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-PW1wx\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25001-introducing-bleeding-heart-pigeons","category":"introducing","date":1385046815000,"wpid":25001,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282751562,"updatedAt":1588441760923,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/5bc1b9370d0e886e05646da8c296780ab3d3572f.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
