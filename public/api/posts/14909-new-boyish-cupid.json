{"id":"5e9c2abc9b6559241525d4be","artists":["5e9b68da7a1236eccfeb1e90"],"title":"New: BOYISH – Cupid","content":"<p>Since discovering Japan tweegaze outfit <strong>BOYISH</strong> <a href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/14460-new-boyish-blindfold/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier in the year</a>, I’ve developed a real soft spot for the group. Their addictive, cutesy vocals and <strong>Pains Of Being Pure At Heart</strong> inspired guitar riffs coupled with a heavy dose of reverb makes <em>Cupid</em> a fantastic listen, and puts <strong>BOYISH</strong> at the forefront of a rapidly expanding independent Japanese music scene.
