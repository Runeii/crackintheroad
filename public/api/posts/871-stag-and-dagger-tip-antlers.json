Boasting one of the most impressive line-ups of any independent festival in the UK, including the likes of former <em><strong>CitR</strong></em> interviewees <strong>A Place To Bury Strangers</strong>, <strong>Blood Red Shoes</strong> and <strong>We Were Promised Jetpacks</strong>, there is no doubt that this event is one not to miss.</p>\n<p>So in anticipation of this sure to be brilliant night, <em><strong>CitR</strong></em> will be bringing you a daily tip on who to check out at the festival. Our first recommendation are Brooklyn based indie band <strong>The</strong> <strong>Antlers</strong>, fronted by <strong>Peter Silberman</strong>. Originally a solo performer, <strong>Silberman </strong>decided to recruit a full band to record his third album; last years critically acclaimed <em>Hospice</em>, which tells the story of a man witnessing a cancer patient’s struggle with the emotional and physical pain of the illness. After the initial success of the album, <strong>Silberman</strong> and co. signed with French independent label <strong>Kiss Records </strong>who re-released <em>Hospice </em>in early August last year. Combining intricate lyrics and beautiful vocals harmonies, <strong>The</strong> <strong>Antlers</strong> are set to be one of the bands of the evening.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/theantlers\">Check Out The Antlers Myspace</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.staganddagger.com/\">Buy Tickets For Stag And Dagger</a></p>\n","slug":"871-stag-and-dagger-tip-antlers","category":"music","date":1274247929000,"wpid":871,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/06/antlers2-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQMG/8QAJRAAAgEEAQEJAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFERITBiEiQVFUkaHR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgT/xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIRIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8ArbdtMvJgrhUvZihRXTm526nz+DWJlzGQEjiS6vI3BPJDHJ4T6UJbTy9TML1X4hX0OR0NOAPruo5M/mQigZbIAa9y/wC1PuvYyos//9k="},"createdAt":1587295264644,"updatedAt":1588403567697,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/antlers2-188x188.jpg","categories":["music"]}
