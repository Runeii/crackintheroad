Showing two young couples exploring each others bodies and their adolescent love for each other, I’m tempted to mark it as NSFW, however whether that’s my cautious manner getting the better of me, who knows. Anyway, check out the saucy video below and stream the full EP via <a href=\"https://softlighting.bandcamp.com/album/glamour-shots\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/45039671\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17188-video-soft-lighting-so-good","category":"music","date":1341536807000,"wpid":17188,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284973574,"updatedAt":1588441776074,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273ad5e5e992f732f8dc2f04cb4.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
