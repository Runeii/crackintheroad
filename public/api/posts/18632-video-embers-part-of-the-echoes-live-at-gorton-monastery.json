Violin players and cute choir girls included, it’s paves the way for slightly more raw comparisons, with the exuberant drumming providing a stunning backdrop to the purposefully strained, <strong>Hope of the States</strong>-esque vocals. So there’s a chorus, and at a (mere) five minutes, it’s potentially more radio accessible, and certainly tailor made for the live circuit.
