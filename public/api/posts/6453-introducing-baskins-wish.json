In their native Newcastle they’re one of the most established bands in the city, yet bizarrely the fascination for the band has never really transferred out of the north. This is in no way a reflection on their music however; they make effortlessly charming punk-pop with a devilish sense of humour and they make it extremely well. The main problem seems to lie with the large amounts of time between gigs, it seems this is about to change. With a line-up of dates being released along with a new, and remarkably more mature, new EP: 2011 could be the year <strong>Baskin’s Wish</strong> get the attention they deserve. Download the new EP bellow.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=736929411/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://baskinswish.bandcamp.com/album/dailyfun\">Dailyfun by Baskin’s Wish</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"6453-introducing-baskins-wish","category":"music","date":1302283148000,"wpid":6453,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/04/basinswish-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcI/8QAIxAAAQMCBQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBgcRITETFEJSYf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECMUH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AKfhGzWyVlfhTubdCe0gpdHUYSrRZRurcc/eazfdo7Ius0BpsAPL8R7GlKnQlSP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294528533,"updatedAt":1588443779010,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/04/basinswish-292x50.jpg","categories":["music"]}
