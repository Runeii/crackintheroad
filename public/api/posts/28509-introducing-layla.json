Her sound is undoubtedly pop, featuring her <em>Florence Welsh-</em>style vocals which are complemented by perfectly timed piano and drum beats. What sets her apart is the dramatic set-up of each individual song, which could easily be imagined as the backdrop to a piece of theatre.  Personal favourite track from the EP is <em>Smokestacks</em>, brilliantly showcasing the drama of her sound.</p>\n","slug":"28509-introducing-layla","category":"introducing","date":1401979356000,"wpid":28509,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282099558,"updatedAt":1588441756723,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d09","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273ce8df4288c66cd5aca23734b.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
