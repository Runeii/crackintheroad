They are one of the country’s best crews and have kept true grime alive and kicking not only in their area, but across the entire country. Each member has a unique spitting style and has featured on BBC, JDZMedia, SBTV and much more.</p>\n<h3>Hardy Caprio</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVuN1sH73cQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Traditionally, grime was tied to Bow and East London. 2015 has changed that;, now it’s all about the South. The success of artists like The Square and Stormzy has changed the game and Hardy Caprio is the next in line to re-define grime’s boundaries.</p>\n<p>Hailing from Croydon, Hardy Caprio has a slick, versatile flow and is set to be one of the stars of 2016. Catch him while you can.</p>\n<h3>Snowy</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/229860012&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Nottingham has become a hotbed of grime activity and, alongside Izzie Gibbs and Mez, Snowy is one of its leading lights.</p>\n<p>Snowy has a tight flow and is a phenomenally exciting prospect for the genre. Expect to be hearing a lot more from him over the coming 12 months.</p>\n<h3>Cloudy Tribe</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/233289187&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Cloudy Tribe cannot be confined to a single genre. While their sound is heavily influenced by grime, the collective pulls in sounds from everywhere.</p>\n<p>The London-based group is united behind a love of woozy beats and they’re guaranteed to put on an energetic and raucous live show.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>Make sure you bring yourself down to Birthdays on the 13th January, it’s gonna be great fun and easy on your wallet.</p>\n<p>You can get more information about the whole thing here: https://www.facebook.com/events/1678526605727192/</p>\n<p>See y’all soon!</p>\n","slug":"31897-citr-vice-present-grime-roots","category":"citr-events","date":1450953191000,"wpid":31897,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587280222035,"updatedAt":1588441790390,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/99fba4b83978e8fd6ff4ca5da07201ea5103f274.jpg","categories":["citr-events","events","music"]}
