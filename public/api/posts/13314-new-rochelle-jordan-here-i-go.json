So, if you needed any further temptation to check out her music, here it is, in the form of new track <em>Here I Go</em>. Where <strong>Drake</strong> is too soppily cliched and <strong>The Weeknd</strong> is too sleazy, Jordan squeezes herself in the middle, hitting the honest and emotional yet sensual and classy nail right on the head. This number appears pretty heavily <strong>Beyonce</strong> inspired, with the repetitive, slightly wooden beat lending itself to<strong> Jordan’s</strong> sassy vocals. Check out <em>Here I Go</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4238808373/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13314-new-rochelle-jordan-here-i-go","category":"mpfree","date":1324415530000,"wpid":13314,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":110,"src":"2011/12/395932_246548802078514_127970133936382_613738_1091002092_n-165x110.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAgEAACAgAGAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADBQYRITFhEkFx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIGBNXhSo9VNlnnSwtZn13BBA04PJ36k2/MdZusJVySx9d/YiHNY3//Z"},"createdAt":1587293204355,"updatedAt":1588403543810,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/12/395932_246548802078514_127970133936382_613738_1091002092_n-165x110.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
