{"id":"5e9c044a774c2610387e4c2d","title":"Designer Profile: Rachel Greig","content":"<p>Rarely is a Spring/Summer collection able to combine foil fringing, medieval nun’s headgear and crumpled morning-after the night-before bedsheets, and succeed in maintaining any kind of worthy message.</p><p></p>\n<p><b>London College of Fashion</b> graduate <b>Rachel Greig </b>borrows silhouette and fabric inspiration from classical 15th century paintings – take the pleated ‘wimple’, a headdress traditionally worn by medieval women – and injects them with comical references to the modern drink and drug culture typically exemplified by young Brits abroad.</p>\n<p>Throughout this collection the concept of the pilgrimage is approached both as a metaphorical and a physical journey, concluding in a gloriously eccentric metafictional account of the two. Not only are we led to consider the static state of ridiculousness in a contrast of religious pilgrimage versus ‘lads’ hol’; there is also a process of personal development underway within the collection itself, for which the rite of passage journey – in whatever form it may take – is deemed a fast-working catalyst.</p>\n<p>Gold and silver fringing and jersey numbers splattered across the backs of garments give the looks a sport-luxe feel, and allude to the pack mentality and uniform in groups of bronzed post-teen ASBO’s on a ten day bender in Magaluf. The garments move and shimmer down the catwalk with buoyant energy: in particular the gold fringed coat, which stands tall, proud, and inappropriate, like an over-enthusiastically decorated Christmas tree. In August.</p>\n<p>It seems the designer’s experience interning at Giles Deacon last year earned her a dose of Deacon’s infamous sense of artistic humour. And she wears it well.</p>\n<p>You can check out her profile on Showtime Arts <a href=\"https://showtime.arts.ac.uk/RachelGreig\">here.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/fashion-2/24126-designer-profile-rachel-greig/attachment/gold-coat/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-24129\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24129\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/09/GOLD-COAT.jpg\" width=\"273\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/GOLD-COAT.jpg 273w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/GOLD-COAT-200x300.jpg 200w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/GOLD-COAT-33x50.jpg 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/fashion-2/24126-designer-profile-rachel-greig/attachment/blue-coat/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-24127\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-24127 alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/BLUE-COAT.jpg\" width=\"273\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/BLUE-COAT.jpg 273w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/BLUE-COAT-200x300.jpg 200w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/BLUE-COAT-33x50.jpg 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px\" /></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/fashion-2/24126-designer-profile-rachel-greig/attachment/lineup/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-24130\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24130\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/LINEUP.jpg\" width=\"767\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/LINEUP.jpg 767w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/LINEUP-300x127.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/LINEUP-50x21.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/fashion-2/24126-designer-profile-rachel-greig/attachment/lineup-back/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-24131\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24131\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/LINEUP-BACK.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"301\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/LINEUP-BACK.jpg 768w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/LINEUP-BACK-300x118.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/09/LINEUP-BACK-50x20.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></a></p>\n","slug":"24126-designer-profile-rachel-greig","category":"arts","date":1378311032000,"wpid":24126,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283018064,"updatedAt":1588441762836,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d4b","old_image":"2013/09/feature-165x165.jpg","categories":["arts"]}
