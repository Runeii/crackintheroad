Hailing from the same state as folk-pop’s biggest star, a certain Mr <strong>Iver</strong>, there are several similarities in the sparse instrumentation and disjointed crescendo’s that littered <strong>Justin Vernon’s</strong> debut LP, however<strong> Haunter</strong> throw a more psychedelic element into the mix, merging slightly off-putting samples and the overpowering sense of death fused with melodrama.</p>\n<p>From the creepy sample found on <strong>Molly</strong> to the uplifting chorus of <em>Take Me Back (To Those Times)</em>, <strong>Haunter</strong> stamp their own individual authority on each and every track on the self-titled release. There’s a gothic, sultry vibe to much of the record, yet underpined by the stunning vocals and harmonious instrumentation. Check out the full release below, in particular my highlights,<em> Laura Palmer</em> and <em>The Glue</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3619306605/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18140-introducing-haunter","category":"album-reviews","date":1351004442000,"wpid":18140,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":503,"src":"2012/10/164594103-1.jpeg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAUH/8QAIhAAAQIGAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFBhIhIhETFHHx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAX/xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAwACERQh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwA9zVoVWXpMxUizlItu9oupPVIMRfAcP2Ec2tRsarMlRLWSxgTx0NajC1jmr3BFusR2V9RZGZ//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284592225,"updatedAt":1588403535680,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/10/164594103-1.jpeg","categories":["album-reviews","introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
