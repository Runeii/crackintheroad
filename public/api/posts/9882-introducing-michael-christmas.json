Before I go on, let me clarify that I use the word racket in an entirely complimentary way when discussing <strong>Michael Christmas</strong>. After posting a collection of nine demo tracks on their <a href=\"https://dalijensen.bandcamp.com/album/demos\">bandcamp</a> earlier this month, I’ve been well and truly hooked on their brand of no-punches held, grungy rock. Mixing the warm fuzz of <strong>Wavves</strong> with guitars that bring back pleasant memories of <strong>The Refused</strong>, these guys know precisely how to generate a dirty, raw sound.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3187069829/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Of the nine tracks available so far, highlights include the no strings attached rock of <em>MEETHead</em> and the slightly more subdued, but no-less-awesome<em> …you oughta know</em>. The vocals are distorted and delivered with a passionate agitation, the guitars are coarse and driven, and the overall energy of the tracks is quite astounding. Imagine<strong> The Vaccines</strong> but with balls and instead of chiseling formulaic, outdated indie tracks, they gave it their undying all; then they’d probably sound a bit like <strong>Michael Christmas</strong>. Head over to their bandcamp to download the demo collection for free.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4015319236/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"9882-introducing-michael-christmas","category":"music","date":1313183749000,"wpid":9882,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/3949426878-1-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgQF/8QAJRAAAgIBAwIHAQAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABhIhMQUTIyRBQ2GR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAb/xAAZEQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQECIWH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AItmVKNHasEQas9vnysR8V5rIwGBjHbGANKF8PoBQHij5AdfS+f5oPs+NE2c8iIqyG04LAYJwq46/mtqK5a8pPczdh9h0WWsKK/D/9k="},"createdAt":1587294093813,"updatedAt":1588403550999,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/08/3949426878-1-165x165.jpg","categories":["music"]}
