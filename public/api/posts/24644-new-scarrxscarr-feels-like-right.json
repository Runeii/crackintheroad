Internet hype machine, you’re letting me down.</p><p> This excellent ‘debut’ track (I say that as <strong>scarrXscarr</strong> has featured on CitR previously, under another name), from San Francisco’s <strong>scarrXscarr</strong> is a bold first outing, experimenting with a very current R&B / indie sound. Layered vocals and smooth synths dominate this self-described ‘primal / mood pop’, with touches of SOHN and The Weeknd littered throughout. Check out <em>Feels Like You Were Right</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/114500817\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24644-new-scarrxscarr-feels-like-right","category":"music","date":1381949860000,"wpid":24644,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282869557,"updatedAt":1587825861973,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","new"]}
