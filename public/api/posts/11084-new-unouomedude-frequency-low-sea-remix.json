So far his music has been fairly untouched in terms of remixes. In a sense, it stands to reason; his music isn’t exactly in a region that inspires a need for reinvention, after all it’s doing most of that itself. But then in swooped Irish duo <strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/low-sea\">Low Sea</a></strong> who did their very best to prove me wrong. The track isn’t pretty, seeming cobbled and jumbled and ultimately becoming a dishevelled patchwork quilt of sounds and textures. Yet it still manages to get the heart pumping, it seems to inflame and maximise the teenage angst that perhaps wasn’t as evident in the original. It might blemish the subtlety of the original track, but it does it in the most enjoyable way possible.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23090954\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23090954\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/low-sea/frequency-low-sea-remix\">Frequency (Low Sea Remix)</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/low-sea\">low_sea</a></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"11084-new-unouomedude-frequency-low-sea-remix","category":"music","date":1315844919000,"wpid":11084,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/unouomedude-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAYH/8QAJhAAAgAEBQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFBhEUIVEHEiJDYWJxsf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAGBEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALrFF9l2mbaEoZ9OtROIYpnm/BIHH3GmUterU0lmmr3FAT4+0GDEbu3UCzksxOjUbn5tCCt5Ogpt/TX8ET70KvwZsJhpAnf/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293887378,"updatedAt":1588403548447,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/09/unouomedude-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","remixes","new"]}
