The first dose of his work was originally presented as an unofficial Mixtape named <strong><em>‘Pawncho’</em></strong>. Since then the jams have been repackaged, 3 tracks have been added and the set has been renamed <strong><em>‘AllXLegends’</em></strong>. The tracks themselves have a remarkable similarity to the work of <strong><a title=\"New: The Weeknd – Thursday\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/10287-new-the-weeknd-thursday/\">The Weeknd</a></strong>; yet still manage to offer something different entirely. The set of 9 instrumentals are slow, sexy and seductive, with subtle and gentle introductions of bass offering a seedy underbelly to the glistening and pristine productions.</p>\n<p>Apart from the Mixtape and the fact that <strong>DropXLife</strong> is part of the <strong>XO</strong> collective, very little else is known about the man/woman. It’s likely this will continue, but when it comes to <strong>XO</strong>, that’s half the fun.</p>\n<p>Stream the original <strong><em>Pawncho</em></strong> Mixtape below and download the completed <strong><em>AllXLegends </em></strong>Mixtape <a href=\"https://www.sendspace.com/file/qexoff\"><strong>here.</strong><br />\n</a><br />\n<object width=\"100%\" height=\"205\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1060489&theme_color=&color=000000&show_comments=false&g=1\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"205\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1060489&theme_color=&color=000000&show_comments=false&g=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"11264-introducing-dropxlife","category":"introducing","date":1316034081000,"wpid":11264,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":128,"src":"2011/09/dropxlife-165x128.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIRAAAQMEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAARIUEFBhIxMmH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBP/EABgRAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhES/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDG+lZUSLxkpp51OUd6Xkkg49hawJ8iw3Y7qPehPKecISkgqJBSoWOdfKUohpWoTrEG/9k="},"createdAt":1587293855710,"updatedAt":1588403548008,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/09/dropxlife-165x128.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
