Other than that, very little is known about Luxury, however for what we lack in biographical information, Smith has not left us short on music, as his Soundcloud boasts of five full, equally exciting tracks.</p>\n<p>Ranging through a whole range of tempo, Luxuryâ€™s musical output is incredibly engaging and intriguing. Transcending periods of electronic haze and blistering moments of clarity, we await an official release from Luxury with eager anticipation.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F95738394\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F95738170\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22690-introducing-luxury","category":"introducing","date":1371818292000,"wpid":22690,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283360167,"updatedAt":1588441765070,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/6e02aa6759a9e7621afaa04e8270369fa0060a27.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
