Tagged as ‘drunken nights’ and ‘unnecessary fights’, <em>Annie</em> is the girl you could never let go of, yet who held your heart through it all… and this song is for her.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3283742413/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://cryingatprom.bandcamp.com/track/annie\">Annie by Prom</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16807-new-prom-annie","category":"mpfree","date":1338928498000,"wpid":16807,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285144431,"updatedAt":1588441777309,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/dd01927f97961d92fc1a9d8bfd65a6509c727720.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
