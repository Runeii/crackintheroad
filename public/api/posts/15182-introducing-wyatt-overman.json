Part of the attraction to <strong>Wyatt Overman</strong>, is his sonic similarities to <strong>Kim Janssen</strong>; one of my favourite acoustic artists of the past few years. There’s the gentle flutter of<em> Children</em> and the denser, piano accompanied hum of<em> Loom</em>, yet opening track <em>Islands</em> stands head and shoulders above the other two, not that they are poor by any means. It’s a simple song yet containing such undying beauty in it’s three minute length, with the line ‘we built our fires as tall as trees, I fell in love with the back of your knees’ being the ultimate declaration of love.
