Seeing past what appears to be obvious intentions of gaining success is not always easy, however, thankfully<em> Leave This Behind</em> does more than enough to cast aside any doubts as any predetermined ideas <strong>Lovelier Other</strong> may possess. Silky smooth vocals and a <strong>Beach House</strong> aroma waft past in an elegant manner, yet with no attempts to disguise that the song is anything other than pop music, but it’s bloody brilliant pop music.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F67320331?\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18333-new-lovelier-other-leave-this-behind","category":"music","date":1352931865000,"wpid":18333,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284498552,"updatedAt":1588441773670,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2731a2bd47d75bb2b22d8332e2d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
