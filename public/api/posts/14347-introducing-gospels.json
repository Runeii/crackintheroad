Comprised of <strong>Alex Frenkel</strong>, <strong>Mike Gordon</strong>, <strong>Alex Marans</strong> and <strong>Owen Murphy</strong>, their debut three track release entitled <em><strong>Greenhouse Session I</strong></em> is a wonderful coalescence of dream pop and folk inspirations.</p>\n<p>There’s touches of <strong>Fleet Foxes</strong> and <strong>Band of Horses</strong> amongst their trio of tracks, most noticeably on the superb <em>White Fence</em>, that begins as a vocal led number before opening out into an expansive <strong>Foals</strong>-esque track, complimented by a jagged guitar riff. However my personal favourite is the stunning <em>Animal Feelings</em>, a track that flows so naturally that it’s impossible to not be seduced. It’s clear that there’s a strong understanding between the group, which is excellently portray by these well-rounded debut tracks, marking them out as a one to watch in 2012. Check out <em>Animal Feelings</em> below, and head over to their <a href=\"https://gospelsmusic.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> for a download of all three tracks.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=499118327/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14347-introducing-gospels","category":"introducing","date":1327162735000,"wpid":14347,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293029056,"updatedAt":1588441783286,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273f04129560646f61b5d921686.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
