His two debut demos,<em> Biggest Love</em> and <em>Refugee</em>, are out and out pop numbers that, with slightly cleaner production, could easily make a run for the charts, yet all that said, I’m still on the fence about ZEE, and if anything, it’s the touches of <strong>Pet Shop Boys</strong> that make me believe that there’s something here.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F110862139\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F112101478\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24390-introducing-zee","category":"introducing","date":1380150349000,"wpid":24390,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282946431,"updatedAt":1588441762234,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/eadb33fd6f038bd72a578f42953df571c45c3c0c.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
