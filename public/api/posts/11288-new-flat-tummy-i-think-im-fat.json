America’s Next Top Model. We all know how much each of those suck (double entrendre intended), and this track from<strong> Flat Tummy</strong> is the ideal antidote to any gripes against such issues. To be honest, I’m unsure as to whether this is ‘new’ or not, as the bandcamp date states 1996, however either way, it’s too awesome not to hear. Tagged as ‘preteen angst’ and ‘riot grrrl’, I can’t really think of a better way to describe the garage punk influenced <em>I Think I’m Fat</em>. With lines such as<em> ‘I live on diet soda ‘cus I think I’m fat’</em> and<em> ‘I read my mothers Cosmo and I think I’m fat’</em>, it’s the perfect Scott Pilgrim-esque retort to a world of image driven whores and fashion obsessed divas.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2814346519/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://flattummy.bandcamp.com/album/flat-tummy\">Flat Tummy by Flat Tummy</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11288-new-flat-tummy-i-think-im-fat","category":"mpfree","date":1316125552000,"wpid":11288,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":350,"height":350,"src":"2011/09/1013283960-1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587293842712,"updatedAt":1588403547828,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/09/1013283960-1.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
