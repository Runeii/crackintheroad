The track’s an obvious departure from 2010’s six-string-centric (and fecking badass) <strong><em>Robin Hood Waiter Champion</em></strong>, but Hayes has never been one to toe the line, and what the rest of the record’s going to be like is just freakin’ killing me.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F41765032&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a title=\"Get your rocks off, honey\" href=\"https://shoesandsocksoff.tumblr.com/\">Put your hands together for the positive recluse. </a></p>\n","slug":"15950-new-shoes-and-socks-off-tork-sport","category":"music","date":1333390936000,"wpid":15950,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292583275,"updatedAt":1588441779479,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2735e9380ed90cd1492db882ed8.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
