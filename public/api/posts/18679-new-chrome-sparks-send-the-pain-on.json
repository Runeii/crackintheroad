The remarkable little tune, <em>Marijuana</em>, saw his colourful and excitable jams thrust on the ‘blogs that more than just the writers’ mums read stage’, which is an exciting prospect, as homely as our pages are. His newest cut, <em>Send the Pain On</em>, sees Jeremy Malvin in just as colourful a mood. Glorious synths command, vocals hail new gods and snare drums echo. All to the backdrop of the ominous title, <em>Send the Pain On</em>. <strong>Sparks</strong> doesn’t want to wallow however, he’s telling pain to fuck off, and he’s saying it very loudly.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F70675060\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18679-new-chrome-sparks-send-the-pain-on","category":"music","date":1355259932000,"wpid":18679,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284363042,"updatedAt":1588441772762,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/86bfdfb05b11fbadb2feb7e4b97e9521d136c55b.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
