There’s dream-pop inspirations on this new track, reminiscent of <strong>Twin Shadow</strong>, most notable in the reverb tinged vocals; a track sure to cement their profile as one of 2012’s acts to watch out for. Check out <em>Dashing In Passing</em> below, which features on their upcoming EP <em><strong>Another Night’s Dreams Reach Earth Again</strong></em> released April 2012 on <a href=\"https://thesoundsofsweetnothing.bandcamp.com/track/dashing-in-passing\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Sounds Of Sweet Nothing</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F35961530&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14722-new-outfit-dashing-in-passing","category":"music","date":1328715647000,"wpid":14722,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292905706,"updatedAt":1588441782351,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273a18b24959e7f935c5948ee84.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
