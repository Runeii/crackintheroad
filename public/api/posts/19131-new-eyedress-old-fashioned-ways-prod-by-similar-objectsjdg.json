There’s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/eyedress\">LOADS</a> of the stuff, not all of it good, granted, but always excited and eager to please. This new track however, keeps getting better with every listen. Like all his work, it wears its heart trodden themes firmly on its sleeve, but he explores them with such sun-kissed textures, it’s almost as if he’s sound tracking the end of a holiday romance. Faded, finite, but still beautiful.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74901990\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19131-new-eyedress-old-fashioned-ways-prod-by-similar-objectsjdg","category":"music","date":1358271046000,"wpid":19131,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":725,"src":"2013/01/eyedress2.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAIBAAAQMEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEiEGEROB0f/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAGBEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACEiH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALd1udjkwnHoYRGvMeEoRW3VhJkOqVie0bz0CfdYIcu5WkYpcjADQHhHylKNg0y9ek//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284179065,"updatedAt":1588403533277,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/01/eyedress2.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
