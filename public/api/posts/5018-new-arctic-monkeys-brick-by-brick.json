Brick By Brick, debuted in the perplexing video below, is a stomping Queens of the Stoneage type number, seemingly composed of one long chorus. Whilst their third album Humbug disappointed and split opinions with many of their fan base, if their fourth record continues in a similar vein to Brick By Brick then it will no doubt do the same. As always, we’d love to hear your opinions on it!</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/riV77WoFCBw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"5018-new-arctic-monkeys-brick-by-brick","category":"music","date":1299267233000,"wpid":5018,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/06/arcticmonkeys-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgQFBv/EACIQAAIBAwQCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECBAMFEQAGITEHEiKT0f/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AGf5TaNtq0JEvEeVc2FCRMFWoW9HpgMqgHoHIB7zjnnWKkeYtyVJFV1v8imGYkItQ4Xnoc9abkRIz2euzx6LFZCAEoDgfLVA2+ECcRI/1L+aOUyzWH//Z"},"createdAt":1587294690542,"updatedAt":1588403559660,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/arcticmonkeys-188x188.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
