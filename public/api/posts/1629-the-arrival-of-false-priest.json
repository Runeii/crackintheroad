This in itself was exciting, but possibly even more exciting than that is how unpredictable this new album is shaping up to be.</p>\n<p>Today the release date, tracklisting and album art of <em>False Priest</em> have finally been revealed to eager <strong>of Montreal fans</strong>. Set for release on 13th September, the tracklisting was exciting, despite it being what we expected – a heavy emphasis on open and sexual song titles such as ‘<em>Godly Intersex</em>‘ and ‘<em>Sex Karma</em>‘ make us gagging for those sexually charged, “trunk rattling bass” gems that Kevin has promised us. What is perhaps even more exciting is the prospect of not one, but two songs featuring collaborations from the wonderful <strong>Janelle Monáe,</strong> as well as a song with <strong>Solange Knowles</strong>. The album art (designed by Kevin’s brother, David Barnes and wife, Nina Barnes) is as beautiful as ever, too, if slightly more chaotic and (if possible) more bizarre than 2008’s <em>Skeletal Lamping</em>.</p>\n<p>Whilst the above is undoubtedly fantastically exciting, and what many <strong>of Montreal </strong>songs have been waiting for for the past two years, it would appear that <strong>of Montreal’s</strong> sound was going just the way the fans had anticipated. Only, that’s not entirely true. With this exciting news <strong>of Montreal</strong> put online the first single from <em>False Priest</em>, ‘<em>Coquet Coquette</em>‘. The first thing you are introduced to is a frantic guitar riff. After that? Well, what sounds like an entire wall of guitars kicks in, in what can only be described as the most rock-orientated <strong>of Montreal </strong>song yet. But, as the song progresses, it unfolds into something that is still entirely danceable, whilst adding a beautiful new level to o<strong>f Montreal’s</strong> genius, in providing a frantic climax that conjures up thoughts which wouldn’t be far off some songs on <em>False Priest</em>‘s titles, most notable ‘<em>Godly Intersex</em>‘. It’s certainly a change in direction for the Georgia band and, whilst it may not be what was expected, I can’t help but feel that they have somehow exceeded the mountain of expectation placed upon them.</p>\n<p>Tracklisting:</p>\n<p>01 I Feel Ya’ Strutter<br />\n02 Our Riotous Defects  [ft.
