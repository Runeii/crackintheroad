A Jekyll-and-Hyde type track conveying lead singer <strong>Matthew Murphy’s</strong> addiction to anti-depressants, whilst also holding the power to uplift the shit out of any drab soul. The <strong>NME’s Mark Beaumont</strong> described it, rather bravely, as a <em>“massive modern day ‘Bittersweet Symphony'”</em>, a line which I’m sure brought a smile to the face of an often morose-looking Murph.</p>\n<p>Strings and thudding drums carry the song, which ebbs and flows wonderfully throughout, eventually building up into a bursting finale. The track wouldn’t be complete though without the trademark Wombats’ ‘ah-ah-ahhs’ and frenzied guitar to further add to the grandeur of the ending.</p>\n<p>It’s been said in the past that the band lack substance, make silly music and try too hard, which has often resulted in them being grouped with the likes of <strong>The Enemy</strong>, <strong>Scouting For Girls</strong>,<strong> The Pigeon Detectives</strong> and other similar out-dated drivel. However, I find it hard to imagine such bands producing a pop/rock track of this quality and enhancing their sound in the way <strong>The Wombats</strong> seem to be doing.</p>\n<p>Out on the <strong>11th April</strong>, <strong>‘Anti-D’</strong> is the last single to precede the follow-up album entitled <strong>‘This Modern Glitch’</strong> which is released in the UK on the <strong>25th April</strong> and can be pre-ordered from <strong>HMV</strong> and <strong>Play.com</strong>.</p>\n<p>Check out the brilliant video too; a colourful mind fuck in American suburbia.</p>\n<p><object style=\"height: 390px; width: 640px;\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/ti1W7Zu8j9k?version=3\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed style=\"height: 390px; width: 640px;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/ti1W7Zu8j9k?version=3\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n","slug":"5064-new-the-wombats-anti-d","category":"music","date":1299546393000,"wpid":5064,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/03/anti-d-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGB//EACcQAAECBAUDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAwAEBRIHERMhQQYiMTRRYWPB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABoRAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMRITH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJ6hdbU+mYfTEnKzTp1E2iFEcFVUnnC3RC4ER55VfiGLOI1W0W9R+evtS62cTLPnLbxGHp6RF+z8gsHDsHvLx7wr5LIG/Iq46tlTr2f/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294681875,"updatedAt":1588443779606,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d49","old_image":"2011/03/anti-d-188x188.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
