(New Version)","content":"<p><a href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/22709-new-space-cubs-why-are-you-resisting-you-know-youre-from-there/\" target=\"_blank\">Stumbling upon</a> <strong>Space Cubs</strong> before her ‘official launch’, the original tracks put online by Suzanne Bonifacio have since disappeared, and subsequently been replaced by a re-recorded version of <em>Why Are You Resisting?</em>. As gorgeously layered as the original, the production is smoother and still centred around the XX-style, bass drum section. Check out Why Are You Resisting below, and keep up with <strong>Space Cubs</strong> on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/spacecubs\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.
