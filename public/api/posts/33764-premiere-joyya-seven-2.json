{"id":"5e9bf7dd8fb2d30d7769c852","title":"Premiere: JOYYA – Seven","content":"<p>This debut track from London duo <strong>JOYYA</strong> arrives with one of the most addictive hooks of the year.</p><p> Having been writing and producing together for the best part of three years, Ben Dancer and David Pullen have now released<em> Seven</em>, the first taste of their exciting new project. Songwriting wise there are elements of the likes of indie pop outfits Foster the People and courtship., whilst managing to maintain a decidedly British feel to it. With more music expected next month, including a track featuring saxophonist John Waugh (The 1975), and plans for live shows in the works, the duo are all set to hit the ground running. Check out Seven below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/330348927&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1KRPfdMMonnZuvwTmlcCo9\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33764-premiere-joyya-seven-2","category":"music","date":1498820395000,"wpid":33764,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2000,"height":1333,"src":"2017/06/joyya-press-2.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHhAAAgIDAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEIQUGEjH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE/8QAGREAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAAgNR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDJZYNR9iB9YzvtTT/CJLVBucJ7Y7WXWv6Z4J9eJtxZl2SoMqqxoPXQKNVd/mMY7LIWBJ7DtWSn/9k="},"createdAt":1587279837679,"updatedAt":1588403499831,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/06/joyya-press-2.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
