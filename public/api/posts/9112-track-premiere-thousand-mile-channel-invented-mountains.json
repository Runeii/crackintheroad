Releases for <a href=\"https://wealthmusic.bandcamp.com\"><strong> Wealth</strong></a> and<a href=\"https://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/album/trouble-b-w-i-wish-you-were-a-monster\"><strong> War Mothers</strong></a> have both been on the radars of the kids at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/crackintheroad\"><strong>Crack In The Road</strong></a>, and rightly so, both are great releases for a label that’s just starting to get its feet off the ground. Their next release is by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Thousand-Mile-Channel/104426779652789\"><strong>Thousand Mile Channel</strong></a>, a bedroom producer currently pursuing a film education in <em>Austin, Tx</em>. <strong>Thousand Mile Channel</strong> acts as James Lambrecht’s housing platform for his various film scores  and instrumental work he produces. He creates work with a duel motive, he has one eye on an eventual visual outcome, while also focusing on creating music that can be heard in its own right. His first release on <strong>Housewarming</strong> will be released on July 15. For now here’s a teaser from the EP, <em>Evanston Collectiv</em>e, a delicate little instrumental, full of flashes of energy and blissful melodies. The beauty is to imagine the film in your head.</p>\n<p>Stream and download the track below.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18705057\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18705057\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad/thousand-mile-channel-invented\">Thousand Mile Channel – Invented Mountains</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad\">crackintheroad</a></span></p>\n","slug":"9112-track-premiere-thousand-mile-channel-invented-mountains","category":"music","date":1310224916000,"wpid":9112,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":90,"src":"2011/07/thousandmilefront-165x90.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAURBAYSMQchQf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAGhEBAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQRIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A2Np78tkYZxbNQnJc8VlGMn511V8vlnQxyuhtc2VJHorSlSPI0Q9izpUXon//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294227096,"updatedAt":1588403553044,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/07/thousandmilefront-165x90.jpg","categories":["music"]}
