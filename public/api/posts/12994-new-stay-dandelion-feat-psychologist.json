Psychologist)","content":"<p>If you haven’t heard <strong>Psychologist’s</strong> debut EP <a href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/5848-review-psychologist-waves-of-ok-ep/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Waves Of Ok</strong></em></a>, especially the gorgeous <em>Comes In Waves</em>, then I’d whole-heartedly recommend that you check it out as asap. With the fragile elegance of <strong>Psychologist’s</strong> vocals in mind, it seems somewhat bizarre that <strong>Stay +</strong> have decided to draft in the angelic voice of Iain Woods on their new track, given the Manchester duo’s heavy trance influences. That said, the spliced vocals and minimal, repetitive beat combine perfectly, building into an epic dance number. With <em>Dandelion</em> set to feature on <strong>Stay +’s</strong> new EP released in February as well as being made available on December 12 via <a href=\"https://recordsaremypillow.bigcartel.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RAMP Recordings</strong></a>, I’d expected the weight of expectation to push the duo into more ‘Sound of 2012’ lists, however maybe the relieved pressure will benefit Farthing and Paul.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29737499\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29737499\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ramprecordings/stay-dandelion\">Stay+ featuring Psychologist – Dandelion</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ramprecordings\">RAMP / PTN</a></span></p>\n","slug":"12994-new-stay-dandelion-feat-psychologist","category":"music","date":1323200673000,"wpid":12994,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293321497,"updatedAt":1588441785372,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/0768370c4f317337b92f4cbfe36373663deb02ab.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
