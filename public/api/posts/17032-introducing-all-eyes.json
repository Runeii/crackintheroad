Of the two tracks, <em>All I Want</em> stands out as a bold first venture, threatening to turn into a track of epic proportions, guided by the fantastically seductive vocals. Despite only having eight minutes of music to their name, <strong>All Eyes</strong> have clearly marked themselves out as a one to watch; needless to say, I’m excited. Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2241790973/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17032-introducing-all-eyes","category":"introducing","date":1340051732000,"wpid":17032,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":109,"src":"2012/06/201110071038006270-165x109.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAHxAAAgICAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBAAFETESEyEj/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgP/xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRAxIh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwC5V0Vy2mkI7J9Oiyv5SQmMSsHgEARJ+98HMz2Ou9GwtKchIYtsoy/WfYJB6xjAsMYrhXa3R//Z"},"createdAt":1587285046627,"updatedAt":1588443773565,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/06/201110071038006270-165x109.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
