To be honest, I don’t really know if this is hip-hop. What I do know is that <em>Chi Glow</em>, the latest cut from Sydney duo <strong>Fishing</strong> is one a hell of a listen. Wrapped in a dream-like electro glaze, the track allows you to drift off, succumbing to the chiming steel drum synths and contorted vocals. This is what <strong>Washed Out</strong> would sound like if Ernest Greene was a rapper.</p>\n<p>Check out the video fro <em>Chi Glow</em> above which features on<strong> Fishing’s</strong> new album <em>Shy Glow</em>, out June 6th.</p>\n","slug":"27951-video-fishing-chi-glow-feat-marcus-whale","category":"videos","date":1397747200000,"wpid":27951,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282207192,"updatedAt":1588441758481,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"generated/ba8e487bc5d851d1f6318cefd4ee3408f437dc47.jpg","categories":["videos"]}
