Now I’ve got that rather pointless fact out the way, let me tell you just how awesome their music is. Formed earlier this year by friends <strong>Jeff Cormack</strong> and <strong>Emily Ashley</strong>, today sees the release of their debut EP <strong><em>Kings</em></strong>. The title track is a gloriously upbeat lo-fi inspired number, combining twee and brash pop-rock into a rather delightful effort. The reverb laden vocals switch between male and female sections, showcasing a romantic dialogue with Cormack proclaiming, “<em>I can feel your heartbeat, all the way across the street</em>” and Ashley wistfully replying “<em>I can see it in your eyes, you’re the one that never cries</em>“. And just wait until you hear that chorus.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, there’s the funky swagger of<em> Ghost Driver</em>, heavily percussion orientated and swirling with dreamy harmonies and the unabashed pop of <em>Reflections And Shadow Casting</em>, which again utilizes the intertwining vocals to scintillating effect. This is gritty pop for your broken heart at it’s very best.
