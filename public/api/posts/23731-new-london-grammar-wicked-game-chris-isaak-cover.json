Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104438387\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23731-new-london-grammar-wicked-game-chris-isaak-cover","category":"music","date":1375906243000,"wpid":23731,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":638,"src":"2013/08/482af010-c6e2-8a5b-0a6dba2e8f342f4f.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAjEAABAwMCBwAAAAAAAAAAAAADAQIEAAURITEGBwgSEyJh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIvhzn5fbeCDFuBHTBwoz1A8hHKQpHtTHkXZyNXVq40+1QRupAQY4hODfiqxqNUj5Iu52ExlfXdaUoP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283126019,"updatedAt":1588403527760,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/482af010-c6e2-8a5b-0a6dba2e8f342f4f.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
