{"id":"5e9c0289774c2610387e4992","title":"Artist Profile: Silva+Cemin","content":"<p>Brazilian couple Rodolfo Cemin and Guilherme Silva are featuring in STITCH’s first exhibition at the Cock ‘n’ Bull Gallery at the Tramshed.</p><p> Go check out their work anytime between January 16th to February 7th and in the meantime Crack In Road will be posting about it on here.</p>\n<p>Working off the principle that “The worth of a picture doesn’t just belong to the man who presses the button” these guys are reinventing the word collaboration. They spend their time running around Brazil, having a good time and taking pictures using random props or their own partly disguised bodies.</p>\n<p>There is a very strong vein running through their work characterised by their bizarre way of representing their world. It’s playful and witty but with a touch of creepy and weird. It’s fashion photography, with models and glitter and clothes. It’s fine-art photography with very sculptural shapes, rich textures and bold composition. This combination of opposites is the root of their ‘brand’, as it were, the + in their names. When I asked them about this they explained:</p>\n<p>“We always work around the “+” in our name, because what we’ve been doing is just the sum of our ideas and vision of art. For us, our pieces are a sum and multiplication between art and fashion, giving birth to a new perception of reality. And inside this perception, fashion is art. It’s all about the plus.”</p>\n<p>It’s really impressive that they can achieve such unison working in this way, and that they have already developed such a distinctive style. I’m expecting big things to come.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://silvapluscemin.com/\">https://silvapluscemin.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cocknbullgallery.com/?p=969\">https://www.cocknbullgallery.com/?p=969</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cargocollective.com/stitchlondon\">https://cargocollective.com/stitchlondon</a></p>\n","slug":"25853-artist-profile-silvacemin","category":"arts","date":1389643243000,"wpid":25853,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":662,"height":993,"src":"2014/01/exhibition-4smaller1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587282569935,"updatedAt":1588403521800,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d2e","old_image":"2014/01/exhibition-4smaller1.jpg","categories":["arts"]}
