Most thought the jury would go for the comical and introspective <em>‘Exit though the gift shop’</em> by street artist <strong>Banksy</strong>. Instead what we have is mixture of intrigue and sub-par art. <strong>Angela de la Cruz</strong> and <strong>Susan Philipsz’s </strong>work however seem to bring something interesting to the table. <strong>Angela de la Cruz’s</strong> sculptures, if one may call them that, comment on the relationship between form, genre and mediums, while <strong>Susan Philipsz</strong> plays with sound and location in some what cinematic ways.</p>\n<p><strong>The Otolith Group</strong> and <strong>Dexter Dalwood</strong> however aren’t so commendable, their work overly pretentious, and in <strong>Dexter Dalwood’s</strong> case too muddled in the style he seeks to recreate. Two out of three isn’t necessarily bad, however with the Turner prize aiming to showcase the best art from across the globe as well as attracting attention from the masses; they may have shot themselves in the foot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/default.shtm\">Check the Turner Prize’s Official Site</a></p>\n","slug":"862-turner-prize-shortlist-2010","category":"arts","date":1274112957000,"wpid":862,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":398,"src":"2010/05/turner07.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMI/8QAHRAAAQQDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBCEDERJhof/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDP2KVFGId4SX7de/K+qz58YvdzGaBuqREH/9k="},"createdAt":1587295270422,"updatedAt":1588403567773,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2010/05/turner07.jpg","categories":["arts"]}
