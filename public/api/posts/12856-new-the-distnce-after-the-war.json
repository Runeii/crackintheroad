Granted, one name isn’t much to go on, but it’s a start. With <em>After The War</em>, the third track from <strong>The Distnce</strong>, <strong>Lucas</strong> maintains the same ethereal, dream pop feel as experienced on debut track <em>Dry Land</em>. It’s simplistic but wonderfully wholesome and immaculately produced, with Lucas bemoaning ‘incase you’ve forgotten, why you always strike first, ‘cus it’s in your nature, to believe the words’ over the top of an organic percussion section. Whilst <strong>The Distnce</strong> is very much still in it’s infancy as a project, the three tracks so far are surefire signals of intent that <strong>Lucas</strong> is in it for the long run. Check out <em>After The War</em> below, and head over to <strong>The Distnce’s</strong> <a href=\"https://thedistnce.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> for a pay-what-you-like download.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3246443639/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://thedistnce.bandcamp.com/track/after-the-war\">After the War by The Distnce</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12856-new-the-distnce-after-the-war","category":"music","date":1322262645000,"wpid":12856,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":590,"height":590,"src":"2011/11/298683_172661372817968_146095785474527_363385_2047775241_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587293373903,"updatedAt":1588403544435,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/11/298683_172661372817968_146095785474527_363385_2047775241_n.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
