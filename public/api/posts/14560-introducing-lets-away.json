Strange, huh?</p>\n<p>Anyway, all that aside, the two tracks that<strong> Let’s Away</strong> have unleashed so far are emotionally fraught slices of indie-pop, taking on a very 60’s-esque mantra, and verging upon becoming full-blown ballads. <em>Only In The Dark</em> is a slow-burner; melodic and despondent in style, like <strong>Alex Turner</strong> at his utmost remorseful, whereas <em>Art Of Self Control</em> displays a rougher edge, retelling a seemingly extremely personal affair. Whilst the duo’s <a href=\"https://letsawaymusic.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> looks rather bare at the moment, and they’re yet to perform live, I anticipate it only being a matter of time before they begin to cause some serious waves. Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26354946&show_artwork=true\"></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26354882&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14560-introducing-lets-away","category":"introducing","date":1328218410000,"wpid":14560,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":950,"src":"2012/02/322627_320970817920935_280678415283509_1199055_1884688244_o-950x950.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587292953168,"updatedAt":1588443775913,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/02/322627_320970817920935_280678415283509_1199055_1884688244_o-950x950.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
