Grasping the listener with mascara stained palms and pleading for forgiveness, swift comparisons were drawn to <strong>The National’s</strong> <strong>Matt Berninger</strong>, in both vocal delivery and lyrical prowess, however <strong>NO</strong> brought the sound into a warmer, slightly more relatable environment. With the group unveiling themselves as a five piece, featuring the talents of <strong>Sean</strong>, <strong>Joseph</strong>, <strong>Reese</strong> and<strong> Mike</strong> and the previously mentioned <strong>Bradley Hanan Carter</strong>, it’s with great pleasure that I present to you their newest track in the form of <em>Another Life</em>.</p>\n<p>With this cut set to open their fantastic upcoming debut EP <em><strong>Don’t Worry, You’ll Be Here Forever</strong></em>, it’s a fitting introduction to a rather special release. The almost effortlessly slick guitars are vaguely reminiscent of <strong>Interpol</strong>, whilst <strong>Carter’s</strong> vocals are once again impeccable, conjuring up haunting similarities to <strong>Berninger</strong>. It’s one of those tracks that comes across as undeniably cool, whilst retaining a respectable level of emotional introspect, with Carter bemoaning “<em>I’ll see you in another life, you don’t walk this way anymore, I’ll see you in another life, I’ll pretend that I don’t think of you</em>“. <strong>NO’s</strong> debut EP is out on 11/11/11 and will be available for free from their <a href=\"nomusicfor.me\">official site</a>; and let me tell you now, it’s well worth a download.</p>\n<p>Check out <em>Another Life</em> below, as well as the previously released <em>Stay With Me</em>.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27536075\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27536075\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nomusicforme/01-another-life\">Another Life</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nomusicforme\">NO.</a></span> </p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23871235&\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F23871235&\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object><span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nomusicforme/no-stay-with-me\">Stay With Me</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nomusicforme\">NO.</a></span></p>\n","slug":"12407-track-premiere-no-another-life","category":"mpfree","date":1320938436000,"wpid":12407,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293515058,"updatedAt":1588441786888,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/9cf2980973fa0944032f9bc9a11f0fe57332f319.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
