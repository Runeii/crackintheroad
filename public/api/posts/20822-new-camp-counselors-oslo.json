Reigle</strong>, the individual behind Camp Counselors, has worked with <strong>Warren Hildebrand</strong> (better known as Foxes in Fiction), for this digital 7″. Comprised of <em>02​/​05​/​11</em> and the instrumental track <em>Oslo</em>, it’s a dreamy, slightly distant release; absorbing yet also existing solely within its own consciousness. 02​/​05​/​11 burns slowly, as extra layers of vocals, and then percussion gradually seep in, whereas Oslo adopts a more post-rock inspired feel, toying with atmosphere to sublime effect.
