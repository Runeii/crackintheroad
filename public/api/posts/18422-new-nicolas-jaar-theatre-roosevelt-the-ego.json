I’d like to make it clear that there’s no way I would have spotted that if <strong>Pitchfork</strong> hadn’t noticed it earlier today, I guess there is a benefit to <strong>P4K</strong> premiering EVERYTHING first. Anyway, as it’s Black Friday it becomes a clear assault on the most odious day of the year. Away from that, we’re left with a vibrating, syncopated, synth-laden and ultimately fun little jam. Enjoy.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F68557140&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18422-new-nicolas-jaar-theatre-roosevelt-the-ego","category":"music","date":1353710317000,"wpid":18422,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":111,"src":"2012/11/nicolas-jaar-165x111.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAHhAAAQQCAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABRIhMVL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhIh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDU5G3isSNGGNhJhxow5ymGWxwcBqgv6FX0PLv3LSzCWtSkosKNg1jGVUJDXD//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284465577,"updatedAt":1588443771756,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/11/nicolas-jaar-165x111.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
