In fact, at the moment all I seem to do is write about their releases. This continues in the form of ambient folk outfit <strong><a href=\"https://www.housewarmingrecords.wordpress.com/\">Grandpa Was a Lion</a></strong>. Their new single, <em>Dancer/Flying Birds</em>, is soaked in romance and devotion, and mummers with child like urges and more mature feelings of realism. Grab some beers, head to the beach and tell someone you love them.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1142884217/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/album/dancer-b-w-flying-birds\">\"Dancer\" b/w \"Flying Birds\" by Grandpa Was a Lion</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"9346-new-grandpa-was-a-lion-dancerflying-birds","category":"music","date":1311795337000,"wpid":9346,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":530,"height":360,"src":"2011/07/grandpa-was-a-lion.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAgEAACAQQCAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAURBiEUMUFh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AscDxsVnxlMjjrZbHzVVpLm0IQsAem0d6JHz9PqpN6uMmvJ5ZELO8jMx23ZJpSgzrKJSqVqP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294173067,"updatedAt":1588403552218,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/07/grandpa-was-a-lion.jpg","categories":["music"]}
