And from the moment that the vinyl (happily available with ease this side of the pond via Big Scary Monsters – but they’re limited to 500, so snap ‘em up quick) is freed from its cardboard postal trappings, it’s obvious that the spectacle is mirrored in the record’s presentation, being as it is a gorgeous picture disc, gilded in all the fiery splendour of the album’s artwork.</p>\n<p>It’s pleasing to note that <strong><em>I Am Gemini</em></strong> represents a marked step forward from 2009’s <strong><em>Mama, I’m Swollen</em></strong>, which proved the ultimate example of frontman Tim Kasher’s tendencies toward self-indulgent misery. Lacking the youth and fresh wounds of <strong><em>Domestica</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mama</em></strong>… reimagined Cursive as The Good Life mark II, slightly more rocking granted, but nevertheless resulting in one of the most unimaginative releases in the Cursive canon. For <strong><em>Gemini</em></strong>, instrumentation has been pared back to <strong><em>Domestica</em></strong> levels, with the exception of the odd crooked keyboard, and without a battery of horns or even that lone cello to rely on for colour, Cursive have had to rethink the personnel-heavy attack of their recent history. Matt Maginn is, as ever, the base coat behind Kasher and Ted Stevens’ duelling distorted caterwauls, locking in songs like <em>Warmer, Warmer</em>, whose sarcastic bounce is exemplary Cursive, and <em>Drunken Birds</em>, which sets the benchmark for Kasher’s lyrical nous, weaving a perverse story as unsettling as any of his various Pinocchial retellings.</p>\n<p>Mirroring its distinct story arc, <strong><em>I Am Gemini</em></strong> is shot through with the kind of musical devices that add to a record’s charm, and Cursive’s attention to detail is a joy to behold. It’s there in the way <em>Double Dead</em> blends seamlessly into <em>Gemini</em>, or pounding, proggish album centrepiece <em>Twin Dragon/Hello Skeleton</em>, the second half of which reprises snippets of the first, skilfully working them into its differing tempo and structure. The craftsmanship is a pleasure to experience, and particularly impressive considering the band’s limited instrumentation – without the extensive arrangements of <strong><em>Happy Hollow</em></strong> to flesh things out, the musicality presented by Cursive on <strong><em>Gemini</em></strong> could have fallen flat.</p>\n<p>On the other hand.</p>\n<p>Without the extensive arrangements of <strong><em>Happy Hollow</em></strong> to flesh things out, the musicality presented by Cursive on <strong><em>Gemini</em></strong> falls a little flat. For some reason, the band’s distortion seems to have been dialled back, which considering the sub-metal guitar antics of album centrepiece <em>Twin Dragon/Hello Skeleton</em> or <em>A Birthday Bash</em> is an odd decision, leaving songs that could really rage lacking punch. There’s little of the bizarre, hookridden fistpumpery that’s populated Cursive records from <strong><em>Domestica</em></strong> onward, the band having largely traded it in for more the more oblique realms of riffage and time signature-worship that’s musically impressive (if not emotionally engaging) at best, and downright gimmicky at worst.</p>\n<p>Conceptually, the record presents us with a difficult attitude adjustment to make, as well. On <strong><em>Gemini</em></strong>, Kasher certainly isn’t wallowing in self-indulgent misery, a point his detractors are so fond of making, but to that end, he’s certainly one of rock music’s most literate and unembarrassing proponents of all things heart-on-sleeve– there’s little arguing with the eloquent emotional heft of, say, <strong><em>Mama, I’m Swollen</em></strong>’s wanton bloodletting. Here, however, Kasher’s dropped the vulnerability and taken up shock value, and there’s hammy acting all over the shop – in the denouement of <em>The Cat and Mouse</em>, where his wild-eyed yells of ‘kill the demon/kill the doppelganger’ border on the ridiculous, or the final lines of <em>Sun and Moon</em>. The song is a particular sting in <strong><em>I Am Gemini</em></strong>’s figurative tail, a reminder that Cursive can write a blinding single, and it’s a reminder that does crop up, albeit briefly, throughout the record. It’s there at the spine-chilling close of <em>Wowowow</em>, blasted out by Kasher and instantly reprised by the record’s ‘Siamese twins’. Ultimately, though, there’s little more to <strong><em>I Am Gemini</em></strong> than rock-complex musicianship and a lukewarm story arc, ending up ‘splattered on the orphanage ceiling’.</p>\n<p>Rounding out a record that’s dualities, dichotomies and juxtapositions the whole way through, I Am Gemini’s physical form (in its first format from Big Scary Monsters, at least) mirrors its superficial flashiness, and ultimate lack of substance. We’re presented with a lovingly etched picture disc, ‘hand-numbered’ (by whom, exactly? In Kasher’s blood? Does it even matter?), and what it’s easy to assume is the record’s sleeve. It’s not a sleeve, rather a single piece of card bearing the record’s artwork, and without inclusion of the extensive lyric sheet either. Let it never be said that Cursive don’t know how to put on a spectacle. <strong><em>I Am Gemini</em></strong> is certainly that, but not a great deal more.</p>\n","slug":"15294-review-cursive-i-am-gemini","category":"album-reviews","date":1330102259000,"wpid":15294,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292767601,"updatedAt":1588441780831,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2012/02/cursive-iamgemini-165x165.jpg","categories":["album-reviews","music"]}
