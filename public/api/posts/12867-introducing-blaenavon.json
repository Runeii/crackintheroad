One act who clearly influence the three piece are <strong>Wild Beasts</strong>, with the vocals and picked guitar sections on<em> Swans</em> drawing particular similarities. Yet <strong>Blaenavon</strong> have a more expansive, post-rock feel that they use to sublime effect, building throughout the epic seven-minute long <em>Swans</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4270186667/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://blaenavon.bandcamp.com/track/swans\">Swans by Blaenavon</a></iframe></p>\n<p>Elsewhere amongst the demos there’s the acoustic simplicity of <em>Denim Patches</em>, a track showing <strong>Blaenavon</strong> at their utmost vulnerable; with the lead singer bemoaning ‘<em>take this moment to think, what might have been</em>‘. It’s a track that appears far longer than it’s five and a half minute run time, but I for one am not going to complain about that. Whilst it’s clear that <strong>Blaenavon</strong> are still very much at the beginning of their career, these six tracks are extremely promising and a breath of fresh air in a rather stagnant UK indie scene.</p>\n<p>Check out a couple of cuts below, and head over to their <a href=\"https://blaenavon.bandcamp.com/album/demos\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> to grab all six tracks for free.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=689368397/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://blaenavon.bandcamp.com/track/denim-patches\">Denim Patches by Blaenavon</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12867-introducing-blaenavon","category":"introducing","date":1322428007000,"wpid":12867,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":767,"src":"2011/11/314297_226799747373065_226798734039833_569203_1159919742_n-950x767.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIG/8QAHxAAAQMEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEEQADBSESEzFB/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAX/xAAZEQADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDIUH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMDnsBkMY4vpxKXt1g2Set3bHFF8cUyQRqJJ1OgIqmNxqWTcqBnrTM2TPn3VKVMx06WxFLh//9k="},"createdAt":1587293367378,"updatedAt":1588443777049,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/11/314297_226799747373065_226798734039833_569203_1159919742_n-950x767.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
