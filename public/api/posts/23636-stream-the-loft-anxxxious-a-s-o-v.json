Despite not writing about it at the time, their talent was more than clear, and it’s potential that’s been fulfilled on their debut LP<em><strong> Anxxxious</strong></em>. Slicker vocals, better production and just oozing with sex appeal, to tell the truth, it’s even more than I’d expected from the duo (Cristian Gomez and Jose Machin). Whilst the influences are worn proudly on their sleeves, the likes of Frank Ocean, How To Dress Well, and of course Justin Timberlake, it’s the impeccable songwriting that serve to make it such a compelling listen.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F103207402\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Take <em>Love</em>, a sensual ballad, toying with balance between human urge and human emotion, all underpinned by the deliciously modern beats. It’s an album for making friends to, an album for falling out to, an album for making up to, an album for making love to, and for all the times in between. The likes of <em>Money</em> and <em>Want</em> wouldn’t be out of place on Channel Orange or House of Balloons, whereas<em> Goodbye & Cloudy Skies</em> is vocally, one of the most impressive tracks I’ve heard this year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F103207418\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>In many ways, it’s remarkable that a group with limited financial firepower (in relation to the aforementioned comparisons), can produce an album of such quality. It’s modern R&B, in it’s fully realised form, merging the immaculate production and composition with the, at times, stunning breathy vocals of Gomez. If the world was a fair place, The Loft would already be opening for Drake or Mr Ocean, and with the right team behind them, alongside more music as powerful as this, there’s no reason why they can’t be.
