I concluded that<strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macklinu\">fthrsn</a></strong> is an appalling name, and that there is literally nothing about this unfortunately named producer on the Internet. He did have a supporting slot at a <strong>Zen Tapes</strong> show however, a show which CITR fave<strong> Chrome Sparks</strong> was said to have played at, so if anything, at least he’s in good company.</p>\n<p>Despite his inability to embrace social media, his new single is actually very good. ‘<em>Nothing’s the matter</em>’ plods along with a set of brutal lo-fidelity production, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macklinu\">fthrsn</a> grim vocals, “your love won’t keep me strong”, clashing with the blissful harmonies that float and circle the track.</p>\n<p>The records b-side, ‘Colors’, is not so full of ideas however, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macklinu\">fthrsn</a> voice is weaker with the afro-pop influences coming across more one dimensional. Despite this, the work as a whole is promising. Now if we can just convince fthrsn to get a Facebook, then you’ll no doubt be hearing a lot more of him/her.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3395482033/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://fthrsn.bandcamp.com/album/nothings-the-matter-colors\">Nothing’s the Matter // Colors by fthrsn</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"9222-new-fthrsn-nothings-the-matter-colors","category":"music","date":1311245917000,"wpid":9222,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":530,"height":336,"src":"2011/07/nothingthematter.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIBAAAQMEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQABAgMEBQcGMRIUIf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AnstyOnsLWecrNb+k1tPyDxjMvES+dA9FYG0SxRFOKrkqQk5v/9k="},"createdAt":1587294194379,"updatedAt":1588403552483,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/07/nothingthematter.jpg","categories":["music"]}
