Recorded for <strong>Glamour Kills Clothing</strong>, the four track<em><strong> GLMR KLLS EP</strong></em> is available for free via their <a href=\"https://www.glamourkills.com/blog/?p=2803\" target=\"_blank\">official website</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Daughter Of A Cop</em> is a delicate, folk inspired number, with Mat’s usual drawl and stunning lyrical ability allowing the track to develop a unique personality. <em>A Bible In A Bath of Bleach</em> uses a similar beat, but slightly sped up, and is very<strong> Coma Cinema</strong>-esque in nature, not a bad thing of course.
