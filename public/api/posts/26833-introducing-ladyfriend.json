What I can say however, is that their (presumably) debut self-titled EP, is rather glorious, for it’s unpredictability, and loveable incoherence. Racing from mock-classic rock (Lace), to R&B infused pop numbers (The Show), there’s touch of everyone from Real Estate, to Conor Oberst, to The Antlers.<strong> LADYFRIEND</strong> truly are impossible to pin down, and I absolutely love them for it. Check out the full release below, I recommend starting with personal favourite, The Show.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1569572148/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26833-introducing-ladyfriend","category":"introducing","date":1392428580000,"wpid":26833,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":960,"src":"2014/02/1898095_273650372794756_79312015_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgEC/8QAIxAAAQIFAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAMFESESMVEGEzJBcf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIG/8QAHREAAgIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQREjKBkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AV1Dp3uz1VBNTfNnSbICZKiApII03A9754JGY0yYOUs5CVOKqSJaQSZt74+Q6mITr8RtxEAxBsxUXjqO5PLnXsx3EeT//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282411195,"updatedAt":1588403518977,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/02/1898095_273650372794756_79312015_n.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
