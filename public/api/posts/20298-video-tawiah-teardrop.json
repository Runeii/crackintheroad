But ultimately it hardly matters; <em>TEARdrop</em> hits the spot within the parameters it sets out for itself.</p>\n<p><em>FREEdom Drop</em> will be released this spring.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDgA3WaGRCc\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20298-video-tawiah-teardrop","category":"music","date":1362596389000,"wpid":20298,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283810976,"updatedAt":1588441768970,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/448bcc33d06e3ad0537f1f626b993d7150bfd1d0.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews","videos"]}
