{"id":"5e9c05a3774c2610387e4dc5","artists":["5e9b68fe7a1236eccfeb20e7"],"title":"New: Green Eyes – Dusk on the 5th","content":"<p>This debut track from New York’s <strong>Green Eyes</strong> feels like it should be wafting out of a slightly seedy, underground dive bar in Brooklyn.</p><p> A vaguely heartbeat-esque steady drum beat is paired with quite 70’s sounding, bleak guitars, both pitted against the sultry yet stunning vocals of Green Eyes. ‘<em>Waves will weep, all for me, and for how you’ve done me wrong</em>‘ bemoans the as yet anonymous singer, drawing from blues and jazz, twisted into a more accesible, emotionally fraught debut track. Coming in at under three minutes, one can’t help but yearn for more music from <strong>Green Eyes</strong>.
