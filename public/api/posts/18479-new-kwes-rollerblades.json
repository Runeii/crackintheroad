The vocals are clearer, backing singers chirp In with sweet harmonies at relevant moments and in essence it’s a far more crystal piece of work. As always, each phase of the song sounds unrecognisable to the last, perhaps best expressed through the tracks synth-drone outro. Above all else, what’s most exciting is <strong>Kwes</strong>’ relentless, and almost always successful depiction of young love.</p>\n<p><em> “your eyes say to me, come rollerblade with me, I will show you the ropes, so hold tight and do not let go of me”</em> – Just gorgeous.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eTwHTdxp4c\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18479-new-kwes-rollerblades","category":"music","date":1353955917000,"wpid":18479,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284451134,"updatedAt":1588441773403,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/11/kwes-12-950x633.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
