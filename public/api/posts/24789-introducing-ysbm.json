I remember seeing James Blake live a few years ago, and feeling that he relied as much upon the carefully placed silences, as he did the beautiful music itself, and <strong>YSBM</strong> feel much like that. Â Mark my words, YSBM are all set for the big time. Check out my two favourites from the EP below, and then the full EP under that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117347391\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117348756\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/13209207\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24789-introducing-ysbm","category":"introducing","date":1382966931000,"wpid":24789,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282824651,"updatedAt":1588441761457,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/b046f132b82f6d8168b3424aac913e2121614a76.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
