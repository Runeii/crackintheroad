After showing she knows her stuff with a <strong>Machinedrum </strong>collab, now she’s spat all over an original<strong> Lone</strong> production – his beautiful rave banger <em>Pineapple Crush</em>.</p><p><strong> Lone</strong> is possibly my favourite UK producer – his blissful style positively killing any memory of ‘other electronic music’ for me when I listen to him. <strong>Azealia</strong> <strong>Banks</strong> has great taste. She also shows why she’s not just another Kid Sister/Amanda Blank/Rye-Rye, and could perhaps be the new Fresh Prince(ss)? She can certainly keep a flow going like the aforementioned ex-high-faded ex-party-rapper. ‘Cept she’s ruder, and more contemporary; she’s down to earth. So nothing like Will Smith then…</p>\n<p>Forgive that awful analogy. More to the point, I can’t wait to hear her debut, despite <strong>Paul Epworth</strong> being quite a straightforward choice to produce her album. But I’m sure you’re all as excited as I am, especially after hearing this joint.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Liquorice below.</em></p>\n<p><center><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F30845226&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F30845226&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object></center></p>\n","slug":"13154-new-azealia-banks-liquorice","category":"music","date":1324140056000,"wpid":13154,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":116,"src":"2011/12/azealia-165x116.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAJBAAAQMDAQkAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFERIGExYXIVFWgdL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBP/EABkRAQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMREv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ar8wCraex260QJjLbD53sdC22S6rTjSQCUqAGT1UBnHatI4juvjc/3Lj/AFSlSYVtti6Wf//Z"},"createdAt":1587293241560,"updatedAt":1588443776801,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/12/azealia-165x116.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
