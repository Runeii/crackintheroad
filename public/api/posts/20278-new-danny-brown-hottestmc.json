Balancing these two strong elements is hard, and <em>XXX</em> didn’t perhaps always have both eyes on the ball. <em>Old</em>, at least in reference to what <strong>Brown</strong> has to say about it, looks set to be a more focused body of work. <em>#HottestMC </em>ironically won’t appear in the LP, however it’s only exciting me further.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F82052924\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20278-new-danny-brown-hottestmc","category":"music","date":1362577636000,"wpid":20278,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283820288,"updatedAt":1588441769104,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/5a9b9840b9fd0b75d862a0b0a3c0af787901d4ab.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
