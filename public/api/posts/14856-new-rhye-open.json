They’ve currently got a 12″ out on <a href=\"https://innovativeleisure.net/\">Innovative Leisure</a>, featuring the above track, ‘<strong><em>Open</em></strong>’. The first thing that will hit you is the strings, recorded to a remarkable level of clarity, they’re unnervingly beautiful marvel to take in. The vocals mirror the atmosphere perfectly; they glisten with a startling level of precision, with the lovesick lyrics, “<em>I’m a fool for your belly</em><em>…</em><em>..the gentle sting between us”,</em> falling gracefully over the listener with a soothing degree of sorrow.</p>\n<p>Things are bad right now, but at least you have this song.</p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2012/02/02/rhye-open-mp3/\">the Fader</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F35335557&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14856-new-rhye-open","category":"music","date":1328829956000,"wpid":14856,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292877307,"updatedAt":1588441782114,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/8a29ff6bdbcfe36f472b05aaf5922ba515074970.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
