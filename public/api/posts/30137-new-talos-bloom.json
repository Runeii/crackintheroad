Produced by Ian Ring of Young Wonder, it’s a delicate lovelorn ballad, as beautiful as anything else released this year. Check out <em>Bloom</em> below, released via Feel Good Lost on 1 December.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\" https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172884673%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-FCg6X&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30137-new-talos-bloom","category":"music","date":1413812379000,"wpid":30137,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281821438,"updatedAt":1588441753464,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/07df718b4507344b8350f6320a7307dda20df89b.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
