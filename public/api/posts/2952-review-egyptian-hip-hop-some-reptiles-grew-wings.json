With<strong> Hudson Mohawke </strong>on production duties there was no doubting that their psychedelic roots would remain very much intact, and their quirky edge would be embellished. So it was no surprise when they released a bizarre demented video for the lead single from the EP; <em>Middle Name Period</em>.</p>\n<p>Entirely instrumental, the lead single shows the strength the band have in finding a catchy yet authentic melody, an innovative track that will surely spawn numerous expertly crafted remixes. Elsewhere on the EP live favourite <em>Rad Pitt</em> has been reworked from demo versions, and cements itself firmly as the bands most complete work to date. “<em>What are we today, enlighten me some other way</em>“, croons lead singer Hewett, an accomplished track, showcasing an expansive, talented side to the group. Whilst many could see the inclusion of <em>Rad Pitt</em> as appealing to the Radio 1 listening-casual music lover, <em>Middle Name Period</em> and <em>Native </em>show that<strong> Egyptian Hip Hop </strong>understand and have confidence in their own ability to experiment and flirt ostentatiously with the boundaries set down for them by numerous chic blogs and magazines. The recordings are cleaner and more controlled, yet <em>Some Reptiles Grew Wings </em>shows tha<strong>t Egyptian Hip Hop</strong> are still light-years from compromising their independent beliefs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/egyptianhiphop\">Check Out Egyptian Hip Hop On Myspace!</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.puregroove.co.uk/products/Egyptian-Hip-Hop-%252d-Some-Reptiles-Grew-Wings-EP-%28Signed-Copies%29.html\">Purchase Some Reptiles Grew Wings!</a></p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_11244048.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"2952-review-egyptian-hip-hop-some-reptiles-grew-wings","category":"music","date":1284918129000,"wpid":2952,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":375,"src":"2011/06/egyptian+hip+hop.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIhAAAgECBQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAUEBhEhMRIiQVGR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAcEQABBAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDERIhQZH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMty7ebDj5IsO1uV3SDQSzMwAIG46QDyTyfW1Xzd7ASS6d3nRCd/lKVU0Ucx0BBO7JojrQ93XV//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294966017,"updatedAt":1588403563629,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/egyptian+hip+hop.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
