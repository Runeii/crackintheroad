Take the 60’s swing of <em>Nothing I Don’t Care For</em>, a track so wonderfully careless that you hardly notice when it slips effortlessly into the<strong> Wild Nothing</strong>-esque drawl of <strong>Pet The Ghost</strong>. Now don’t get me wrong, I love <strong>Darlings</strong>, and for all their energy, it’s quite something that they manage to sound so gloriously and enjoyably apathetic.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=439680519/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19248-introducing-darlings","category":"introducing","date":1358787106000,"wpid":19248,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284129290,"updatedAt":1588441771800,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/5654235bd1f016250eec98075556b68e40a82e5a.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
