Having impressed with previous releases, Boston’s Mood Indigo aka Bailey Lawless, shuffles in somewhere between <strong>Animal Collective</strong> and <strong>Why?</strong> with his hip-hop production and lofty, slightly psychedelic vocals. Newest release, four track EP <strong><em>Welcome To The Woods</em></strong> is potentially his most complete release to date, ranging from the psych-pop of Hint Of Color to the 80’s hip-hop vibe of Good Man Lost.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2493207097/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"410\" width=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21250-new-mood-indigo-welcome-to-the-woods-ep","category":"mpfree","date":1366196500000,"wpid":21250,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":533,"src":"2013/04/201009291953240866.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAIBAAAgAGAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFBhESIRMxQf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAZEQADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDESL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANnCKihzKquVwtpWiuaqPCGk7VJXFQFI+oSGOt8ge4gqJGdpPmKtjtswKxAda/Qbv2ARsCEIBfLHZXq3KP/Z"},"createdAt":1587283610177,"updatedAt":1588403531068,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/04/201009291953240866.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
