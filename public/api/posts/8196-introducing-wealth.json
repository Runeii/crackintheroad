It’s tinny, raw and undisturbed at times; but ultimately descends into an electro odyssey that’s too damn free spirited and playful to ignore. Wealth’s stance on public relations and self-image is equally as audacious; “According to his bio <strong>Wealth</strong> was an All-American quarterback in college who then went on to a career in law enforcement, where while undercover befriended a gang of bank robbing surfers and eventually brought the gang to justice while maintaining a respect for their ideologies.” Not the most believable press release from a record label I’ve ever heard, but as far as adding to an already interesting sound, it’s not half bad.<strong> Wealth’s </strong>debut single, ‘<em>The Battery</em>’, is out on <a href=\"https://housewarmingrecords.wordpress.com/\"><strong>Housewarming Records</strong></a>, download it for free bellow.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1552589075/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-battery-b-w-when-everyday-is-sunday\">\"The Battery\" b/w \"When Everyday Is Sunday\" by Housewarming Records</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"8196-introducing-wealth","category":"music","date":1306366427000,"wpid":8196,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":650,"height":650,"src":"2011/05/wealth.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587294353688,"updatedAt":1588403554984,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/05/wealth.jpg","categories":["music"]}
