Not only is it arguably a better track than the cover on the A-side, but it also proves that Ménage à Trois are talented in their own right. Soulful, moving and devastatingly beautiful, they’re rapidly proving themselves to be one of the UK’s finest new acts. With little information as to their identities, aside from the connection with <strong>WU LYF’</strong>s Joseph Manning (also of <a href=\"www.crackintheroad.com/music/20595-new-los-porcos-do-you-wanna-live-jesus-luvs-u-baby/\" target=\"_blank\">Los Porcos</a>), you can guarantee that their debut cassette will sell out in no time.
