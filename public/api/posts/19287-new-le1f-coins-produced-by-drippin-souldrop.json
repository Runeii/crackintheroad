Taken from his follow up to <em>DARK YORK</em>, entitled <em>Fly Zone, </em><em>the track builds on the sound that brought LE1F to all our attentions. Coins</em> has a remarkable new level of clarity, with <strong>LE1F</strong>’s vocals spared of the reverb that in my opinion was laid on far too freely in the last mixtape. His flow has also improved, with the track coming across as some sort of performance rather than simply a track. If the whole mixtape is as forward, intentionally trashy and performance focused as this, we could have something special on our hands.</p>\n<p><em>Fly Zone</em><em> drops next Monday via </em>Greedhead and Camp & Street.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F75324145\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19287-new-le1f-coins-produced-by-drippin-souldrop","category":"music","date":1358983446000,"wpid":19287,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284111156,"updatedAt":1588441771559,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/37a8eff10c93f31ab88ef99547585093e93b8adf.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
