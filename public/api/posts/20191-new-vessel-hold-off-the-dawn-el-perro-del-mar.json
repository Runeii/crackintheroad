This track is fucking NASTY. Scattered, druggy and wandering, the cut manages to always hold a demonic sort of threat that makes for one uncomfortable listen. In a good way, a really good way.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F81187260\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20191-new-vessel-hold-off-the-dawn-el-perro-del-mar","category":"music","date":1362125626000,"wpid":20191,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283842060,"updatedAt":1588441769345,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/992f456214e3989ccff1f09fea95c164eb773001.jpg","categories":["music","remixes","new","newnews"]}
