Bobby draws influence from across the indie rock landscape and bundles it all together in his unique lo-fi style.</div>\n<div></div>\n<p>“I came up with all of the composite parts during the Carnaval parade in Sion, Switzerland last Valentine’s Day.” Bobby told us “The next day, I stitched them all together into a rough, drunken Jack Torrance demo in the ancient and creepy Hotel Europa (where Verdi used to live and Napoleon once stayed) in Ferrara, Italy. The lyrics came later.”</p>\n<p>—-</p>\n<p><em>Next week we’re <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1521993634764615/\">throwing a party</a> for all of the readers, writers, musicians and artists that have made Crack In The Road what it is today.
