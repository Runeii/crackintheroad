{"id":"5e9c034f774c2610387e4aff","artists":["5e9b69317a1236eccfeb2416"],"title":"Introducing: Pastel","content":"<p>Hailing from Southern California, the music of Gabriel Brenner aka <strong>Pastel</strong>, is rather difficult to place, in that the influences appear fairly obvious at first listen, yet nothing quite fits in the way you might expect it to.</p><p> His six tracks so far are littered with off-beat vocals, disconcertingly twisted synth sections, and a general feeling of unrest, yet don’t let that you put off. From his rather beautiful cover of Feist’s <em>So Sorry</em>, to new track (and birthday gift to his mother) <em>Ode To A Tired Woman</em>, thematically, <strong>Pastel</strong> sticks to the dark, shadow-filled corners of rooms, preferring a foreboding, minimal elegance to a sleek, polished shine. Whilst on first listen you may not take to Pastel immediately, stick with him, and you’ll reap the rewards. Check out a few tracks below, and hear the rest on his <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/pastel_grunge\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120529769\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116175896\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/108873743\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24939-introducing-pastel","category":"introducing","date":1384703674000,"wpid":24939,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/11/artworks-000062972907-wtojh5-t500x500.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQQG/8QAJBAAAQMCBgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDBBFBAAUGEiEiEzEUMmH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Azo6izd3VXjy55OzEcwGTH3q+iVQg3L6NOy2rRUpymKJYSnJbxsvOtNEZEDaMP0BFXhPdsHQ8wmtZaPilyA3NmhbXSStEKlebWwxFM/jM9i+iX/MB/9k="},"createdAt":1587282767848,"updatedAt":1588403524852,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/11/artworks-000062972907-wtojh5-t500x500.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
