This live session featuring <strong>Youth Lagoon</strong> shot by new unique visual experience website <a href=\"https://deerlodge.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">Deer Lodge</a> further cements my belief that there’s something rather special about Boise, setting <strong>Trevor Powers</strong> against a scintillating backdrop of flourishing trees and swirling leaves. I’d keep waffling about the transcendental atmosphere and vivid contrast between the music and the environment, but <a href=\"https://deerlodge.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">Deer Lodge</a> and <strong>Powers</strong> put it best:</p>\n<p><em>“It was a warm October day. We spent the day driving on dirt trails, commenting on Idaho’s beauty and how it’s scenery to most is practically unknown. We parked the cars near a stream and Powers set foot into the woods, keyboard in hand.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>“It makes me think of when the artist first started writing that song,”</strong> he said when discussing his view on intimate, bare sessions.<strong> “For me, this is how the song basically started before adding any production on top. It means something.”</strong></em>”</p>\n<p>Check out <strong>Youth Lagoon</strong> performing <em>The Hunt</em> for <a href=\"https://deerlodge.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">Deer Lodge</a> below, and follow the website via their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/deerlodgefm\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> page.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/39778838?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/39778838\">Youth Lagoon: “The Hunt”</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/deerlodge\">Deer Lodge</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"https://deerlodge.fm/watch-youth-lagoon-perform-the-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\">Deer Lodge</a></p>\n","slug":"16100-video-youth-lagoon-the-hunt-deer-lodge-session","category":"music","date":1334784950000,"wpid":16100,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292541560,"updatedAt":1588441778947,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/8b3b59f363f91d72746f8bd6da8f58e5e5c058f3.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
