A minute  or so into this debut EP from Brighton’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SaintSavanna\" target=\"_blank\">Saint Savanna</a> and you’d be forgiven for thinking that they’re just another tweed-wearing, genre-blaspheming bunch of fanny-monkeys. Thankfully, it’s not stereotypical of their sound, and by the time the chorus of <em>You Won’t Rise</em> kicks in, they’ve well and truly extinguished any Mumford related demons.</p>\n<p>With lines like “<em>thank you for being so brutally honest, but fuck you for saying that you didn’t want this</em>“, there’s a snarl to <strong>Saint Savanna</strong> that is rarely experienced in a ‘folky’ outfit. In truth, it’s only the opening track that has any hints of Mumford to it; <em>Balconies</em> is dream-pop at it’s finest – slightly cheesy and irrepressibly slick. One gets the feeling that<strong> Saint Savanna</strong> are still to find their ‘internet feet’, mainly due to their modestly sized fanbase in proportion to the quality of their music, however with the right direction, expect to hear a lot more of them over the coming months. Check out their debut EP<em><strong> Verona</strong></em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2125573845/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19192-introducing-saint-savanna","category":"introducing","date":1358518394000,"wpid":19192,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":82,"src":"2013/01/486242_128764157280306_690595900_n-165x82.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAII/8QAHBAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDE9FTVKGi/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDOUyNdr1ZMqcDXbAKP/9k="},"createdAt":1587284145296,"updatedAt":1588443770317,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/01/486242_128764157280306_690595900_n-165x82.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
