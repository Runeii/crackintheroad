All-in-all, it’s the strength of the songwriting at the core of these tracks that really stands out, marking Callum Pitt out as a surefire one to watch.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/319691115&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/297869476&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33599-introducing-callum-pitt","category":"music","date":1495105728000,"wpid":33599,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2000,"height":1329,"src":"2017/05/3-2000x1329px.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAgEAACAQMEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMAERIEBQYxFiGh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgX/xAAcEQACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADEiETodH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AL0MizbYjjkGvZdBYs+DAtc9EZe+6iTTRPK7+SbkuTE2EZsPtKVFXkO8z15BbcUAVRqf/9k="},"createdAt":1587279859852,"updatedAt":1588403500681,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/05/3-2000x1329px.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
