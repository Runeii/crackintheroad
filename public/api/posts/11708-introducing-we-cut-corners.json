After spending several hours in hospital on Thursday night (more on that later) I hopped in a taxi and headed straight to the Button Factory, just in time for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wecutcorners\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>We Cut Corners</strong></a>, a pop-punk duo comprised of two Dublin based school teachers. Sounds bizarre, I know.</p>\n<p>For my first real experience of the Irish music scene, it couldn’t have started much better. The performance was tight and vividly engaging; swinging between riff-heavy, almost grunge inspired anthems, to delicate, vocal driven acoustic numbers. It always impresses me when a two-piece can create such a stunning wall of sound, a trait that Brighton duo Blood Red Shoes pull off expertly, and <strong>We Cut Corners</strong> succeeded in maintaining with an air of elegance. It speaks volumes that I remember <strong>We Cut Corners</strong> playing <em>The Leopard</em>, a stomping two minute frenzy of strained vocals and jagged guitars. For a band whose music I hadn’t previously been exposed to, they left a memorably positive impression, with what was quite comfortably one of the most self-assured, wholesome performances I’ve seen in a while.
