Of the trio of debut tracks, <em>Going Places</em> stands out as a future indie hit, with all the twee honesty associated with the UK female songwriters of mid-00’s (<strong>Allen</strong>, <strong>Nash</strong> etc.). As the tags suggest, it’s very much ‘pretty girl voice’, but who’s to say that can’t be brilliant? <strong><em>Deep In Swim</em></strong>, the debut LP from<strong> Hums</strong> is out later today.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1888910338/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18315-introducing-hums","category":"introducing","date":1352767112000,"wpid":18315,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":637,"src":"2012/11/3069_186451471486129_1944802144_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABQYSIiNB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANL425F3TcpyWlt2drZXSN6qLaVIBSex+lJN1lwJNDyrGMD/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284507213,"updatedAt":1588403535442,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/11/3069_186451471486129_1944802144_n.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
