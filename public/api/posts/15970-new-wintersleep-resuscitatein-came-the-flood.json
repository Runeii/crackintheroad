Paul Murphy’s haunting vocals (a particular highlight on their stupendous 2007 album, <em>Welcome to the Night Sky</em>) are as strong as ever, as is the sort of drumming that you’d come to expect from a band founded by a percussionist. ‘In Came The Flood’<em></em> in particular is right in <strong>Wintersleep</strong>‘s comfort zone whilst ‘Resuscitate’ adds just a twinge of something new to their already nicely developed sound.</p>\n<p>Check out the tracks below, and get the album on release in June – it’s bound to be a great one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F42035804&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F41350903&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe> </p>\n","slug":"15970-new-wintersleep-resuscitatein-came-the-flood","category":"music","date":1333652053000,"wpid":15970,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":598,"src":"2012/04/wintersleep-dustin-rabin-copyright.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMG/8QAHxAAAgEEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFEQYSISJR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQb/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDHcl5XVxdzbthgi2QVFNBqY9mI8k/ZB8xjndneyTux2dE63EShK5SYdOyO/9k="},"createdAt":1587292575948,"updatedAt":1588403540312,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d16","old_image":"2012/04/wintersleep-dustin-rabin-copyright.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
