Zane Lowe likes them and so will you. Especially if you like other semi-anonymous electronic sportswear groovers like Jai Paul and that Dutch fella Child of Lov. But you’ll like them anyway. <strong>Jungle</strong> have their own brand of retro sugar: their own signature of words like ‘honey’ and ‘brother’ sung in double tracked octaves; their own selection of watery brass samples.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F109717173\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Their last AA-side single<em> Platoon/Drops</em> was lauded, and this video of a kid break-dancing went viral.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9JkDzNOgO3U\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>‘The Heat’ is doubly infectious. There’s nothing quite like an offbeat chord sequence on a Sega Megadrive synth; listening to the chorus is like stumbling on some secret item in a game you used to play. Enjoy, honey.</p>\n","slug":"24251-new-jungle-heat","category":"music","date":1379158075000,"wpid":24251,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282974171,"updatedAt":1588441762586,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d26","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27349985dc2a923a6fc6c1bd858.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
