{"id":"5e9bf79e8fb2d30d7769c75c","title":"New: Surma – Plass","content":"<p>Portuguese artist <strong>Surma</strong> (Débora Umbelino) is one of my favourite new musicians of recent years.</p><p> In a time dominated by ‘chill’ Spotify additions and constant replication and repetition of artists gone before,  it’s so brilliantly refreshing to hear an artist really carving out their own niche. Sure, there are elements of Bjork and Sigur Ros to Surma’s elegant, stirring compositions, but she’s very much creating within her own space. Not only is the music truly magical, there’s a real artistry to the accompanying videos as well. Check out recent single<em> Plass</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6iHHG4BAq4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"34108-new-surma-plass","category":"music","date":1515678468000,"wpid":34108,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2048,"height":1366,"src":"2018/01/21762751_2081414688754156_2863854610247809990_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMH/8QAHxAAAgICAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAARBSEGIzFR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQf/xAAdEQEAAQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDEhEhQWFx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDMvHL60eNtWa8TjkIgjwzo2jCQ423380OsmeSsuS5tzbbs+18YwV1yfZRLQNJkDscdT//Z"},"createdAt":1587279774366,"updatedAt":1588403497577,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2018/01/21762751_2081414688754156_2863854610247809990_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
