It was smooth as hell, dreamy and more than a little seedy at times. Nothing can be that smooth. Nothing. Well, <strong>Bullion</strong>, <strong>Laura Groves</strong> and Young Turks’ <strong>Tic</strong> are back, (this time without <strong>slime</strong>), and they’ve more than delivered on this ‘difficult second track’. The sound is more expansive, proving that sonically at least, the group have more than a little scope. Plus the violins at the end are to fucking die for.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F68916880&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18493-new-nautic-fixxx","category":"music","date":1354197934000,"wpid":18493,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":539,"height":312,"src":"2012/11/nautic.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAAvElEQVR4nB3BsQpGQAAA4Hsio82L2JXCoCQl3cBABmXRLYrUvYCuW04ZLAaDDIrlkoVVKVF//d8H4jjWNI0xliSJbduWZem6HoZhnudpmgJBEERRNE0z+MMYI4S6ruOc930PJEmqqgpj3LZtXdfneZZlGUURY2xdV+D7/jAMhmEoiiLLsqqqrutCCMdxnKYJIISyLKOUEkI458uyHMdxXde+703TAMdxiqIghGzbdt/3+77f9z3PM8+z53k/ZCd0j/4dBdUAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"createdAt":1587284442707,"updatedAt":1588403535069,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/11/nautic.png","categories":["music","new"]}
