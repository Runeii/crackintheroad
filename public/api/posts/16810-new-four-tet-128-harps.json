Where <strong>Four Tet</strong> excels is through the journey he guides the listener along, seeing his music as more of a palette than merely a four minute expanse of time that needs filling, and you can’t help but feel that he’s getting better all the time.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F48760960&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16810-new-four-tet-128-harps","category":"music","date":1338972419000,"wpid":16810,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285142008,"updatedAt":1588441777283,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/four-tet-511e3c1480d9d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
