When I got home his new track, ‘<strong><em>Flex your gold</em></strong>’, was sitting in my inbox. That’s what you get for rinsing records. The follow up to his self-released single, ‘<strong><em>Wet Dream</em></strong>’, is a remarkably lo-fi endeavor. Reverberating moans and rattling beats form the bulk of the sonic sphere, with <strong>Aviv</strong>’s vocals near but consumed in the arrangement. It’s by no means a large leap forward compared to the efforts of <strong>Aviv</strong>’s past, yet it’s a welcome experiment nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Stream the track below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=395031301/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14684-new-cities-aviv-flex-your-gold","category":"music","date":1328646317000,"wpid":14684,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292920928,"updatedAt":1588441782537,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/44159d4e04ea97f5d19dc97336db3d33076b8e19.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
