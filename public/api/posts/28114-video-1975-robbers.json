As with their other visuals, it’s beautifully cinematic and dramatically composed, really illuminating and inheriting the mood of the track itself. Whilst the spilled blood, excessive drug use and passionate sex scenes are the props, it’s the overarching sentiment of love conquering all that dominates. Check it out below.</p>\n<p>Robbers is taken from their self-titled debut LP, <a href=\"https://smarturl.it/the1975album\" target=\"_blank\">available now</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“you look so cool”</em></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Iyy3YOpxL2k\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"28114-video-1975-robbers","category":"music","date":1398642517000,"wpid":28114,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282170184,"updatedAt":1588441757833,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/94dd2feca73bdfb7e1c12751b499ec0a46024866.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
