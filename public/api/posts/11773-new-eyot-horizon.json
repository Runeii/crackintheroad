Opening with a tinkling piano introduction, the track descends into a swirling mirage of reverb washed guitars, before reaching a crescendo at around the half way mark. <strong>EYOT</strong> may not be the fit in with the conventional style of artists posted on<em><strong> CitR</strong></em>, but <em>Horizon</em> is certainly worth a listen.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1854251973/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11773-new-eyot-horizon","category":"mpfree","date":1318525752000,"wpid":11773,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/10/31085_129666277043796_129662590377498_354848_699191_n-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYH/8QAHxAAAQQDAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAUAESEGEiQx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAmP7SjtKyY68PsMsBMll5AC0kghYB/OdzPp/tKpc6QqLUVIjlxRbCoLQPx3zYCdDmSlKpRq75RJKikbJPT04Dhnr//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293704632,"updatedAt":1588403546004,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/10/31085_129666277043796_129662590377498_354848_699191_n-165x165.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
