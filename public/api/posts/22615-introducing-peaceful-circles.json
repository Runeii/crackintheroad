{"id":"5e9c05ac774c2610387e4dd2","artists":["5e9b69317a1236eccfeb2420"],"title":"Introducing: Peaceful Circles","content":"<p>With the sheer amount of music uploaded onto the internet every single day, it’s crucially important not to underestimate the affect that visual elements can have on whether deciding someone takes a chance with listening to your music or not.</p><p> The stunning artwork provided by Peaceful Circles, for each of their five tracks so far, alongside another for the EP itself, was certainly the deal breaker when it came to pressing play, or ignoring it completely. Hailing from Paris,<strong> Peaceful Circles</strong> have little to information available online so far, barring a five track EP, currently titled <strong><em>Please Name</em><em> Album</em></strong><em> </em>(Tongue in cheek title or have they simply not got round to naming it yet? You decide).</p>\n<p>Sugary sweet dreampop filtered through a gentle shoegaze waterfall, it’s a release that grows with repeated listens, blossoming wondrously whilst remaining startlingly intimate at times. From the opening chimes of<em> 01</em> to the cascading guitar trembles of closer <em>Wave</em>, it’s a thoroughly engaging listen, overflowing with potential. Two standout tracks, <em>Love</em> and <em>Driving Rain</em>, interlock beautifully, with sweeping female vocal melodies pirouetting freely throughout. Check out <em>Driving Rain</em> below, and the full EP under that, oh and be sure to check out their Soundcloud for all the artwork.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F97560556\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F6900710\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22615-introducing-peaceful-circles","category":"introducing","date":1371662391000,"wpid":22615,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283372269,"updatedAt":1587825869971,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
