A second article came in the form of a review of the band’s support of <strong>Hockey </strong>last June, and a third upon the release of their fantastic track, ‘<strong>Broken Record</strong>‘ in October. My fourth article will focus around <strong>Vinyl Jacket</strong>‘s latest release, ‘<strong>Painting Stations</strong>‘, however we must first consider the progress the band has made.</p>\n<p>In less than a year the band has managed to achieve great success in both the <strong>Amazing Radio </strong>and <strong>Amazing Tunes </strong>charts, while also receiving multiple plays on the fantastic <strong>BBC Radio 6. </strong>It doesn’t end there, as the band were also selected as part of the <strong>Best of MySpace </strong>competition, while also receiving national airplay on <strong>Chris Moyles’</strong> <strong>BBC Radio 1 </strong>Breakfast show. I could go on and on about the other achievements <strong>Vinyl Jacket </strong>have conquered in the time since I first gave their tracks a listen, but needless to say <strong>Vinyl Jacket </strong>have only gone from strength to strength, and are in the process of solidifying their presence on the national stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Painting Stations </strong>saw <strong>Vinyl Jacket </strong>record their first music video (filmed locally in Northumberland), and it really is a cracker.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/BBP7Qp-thBU?fs=1&hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/BBP7Qp-thBU?fs=1&hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>Playing very much to their strengths, ‘<strong>Painting Stations</strong>‘ is a showcase of the eclectic influences that are at work in <strong>Vinyl Jacket</strong>‘s sound. Varied yet driven percussion, jangly guitars and springs of synths create a track that is not only upbeat and interesting , but incredibly likable. In my early reviews of <strong>Vinyl Jacket</strong>, I mentioned that the band’s sound was very reminiscent of <strong>The Holloways </strong>and <strong>Vampire Weekend</strong>. While this is very much the case, with ‘<strong>Painting Stations</strong>‘ there is a distinct step forward in the band’s sound. All the key qualities are there, but what some have termed ‘overcrowding’ (Stick to pies <strong>Moyles</strong>) in ‘<strong>Painting Stations</strong>‘, I take as a level depth and complexity. As we have seen with the likes of <strong>Everything Everything</strong>, the most interesting tracks are not those that follow a set pattern of one sound, instead those brave enough to enthrall a listener with sudden changes in tempo, tone and direction are worthy of praise and attention. <strong>Vinyl Jacket </strong>have done exactly this with ‘<strong>Painting Stations</strong>‘, which at one moment can be sharp and jumpy, and then smooth and harmonious the next, culminating to become one of my favourite tracks of the year so far.</p>\n<p>‘<strong>Painting Stations</strong>‘ is out on the 21st February on <strong>The Calico Print</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/vinyljacketuk\" target=\"_blank\">Vinyl Jacket Myspace</a></strong></p>\n","slug":"4622-review-vinyl-jacket-painting-stations","category":"music","date":1297778307000,"wpid":4622,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":720,"height":480,"src":"2011/02/vinyl-jacket.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAhEAABAwQBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMFAAQRIRIWIjFxgf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEE/8QAGREBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCKiJOaahnLfqWUS3x7QFnWPPzGqj37S9U+4pU5dlRUSScknfulKhMt17Ftuf/Z"},"createdAt":1587294740205,"updatedAt":1588403560441,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2011/02/vinyl-jacket.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
