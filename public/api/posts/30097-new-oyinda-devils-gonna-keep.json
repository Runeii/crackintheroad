Her latest single, and third available track, <em>The Devil’s Gonna Keep Me</em>, is another example of her spellbinding poetic nature – “<em>I hear a whisper as the silence spoke / the devil’s gonna keep me</em>“. Another self-produced number, it’s further indication that 2015 is already shaping up to be rather special for Oyinda.
