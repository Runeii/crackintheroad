It’s a worn out cliche, but there really are few bands who have worked as hard as <strong>NO</strong> over the past couple of years, with several colossal tours already under their belts, and presumably more to come, this LP really feels like a combination of their talent and perseverance truly paying off. Cinematic, bold and deeply effecting on an emotional level, it’s a brilliant record, with fantastic songwriting at the very core of it.</p>\n<p>Stream the full LP below, including personal highlights<em> Hold On</em> and <em>So Scared.</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/16898590&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26843-stream-el-prado","category":"music","date":1392678003000,"wpid":26843,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2014/02/artworks-000065066148-epq474-t500x500.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgAH/8QAJRAAAQIFAwQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFETEGBxIUISIkMkGR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIhAwRR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAhQNsJ46bqCKhRHGKmUjp0uzTY8j8uQsSAM5B+oPHY/WCzyQmlcT3HvJx+RuUzMPNUyRU064hRSblKiCbxAC2IRY10nlsOqR//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282408894,"updatedAt":1588403518946,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/02/artworks-000065066148-epq474-t500x500.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
