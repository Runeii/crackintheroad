With 2013 rapidly shaping up to be the year of females with synths, <strong>San Mei</strong> adds her name to an ever-growing list of artists to keep an eye out for over the coming months. Combining the song-writing finesse of <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong> with an almost classical style vocal, she’s a girl with an extremely bright future ahead of her. Check out both tracks below, and grab a free download while you can.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3417426914/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2093639075/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19301-introducing-san-mei","category":"introducing","date":1359039430000,"wpid":19301,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284103488,"updatedAt":1588441771473,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ffd62d7f29ad8b0789d45b807f8e34d456e4d74b.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
