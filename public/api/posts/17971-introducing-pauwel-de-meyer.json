A heartfelt mix of <strong>Elliott Smith</strong> and <strong>Conor Oberst </strong>album opener I Can Do That bares all from the off, lamenting drunken nights and disillusioned love all delivered in the soothing tones of <strong>De Meyer</strong>.</p>\n<p>So the singer-songwriter market is hardly starved at the moment, yet it’s certainly lacking on the talent side of things, with a vast proportion of artists writing for their audience as oppose to transferring their own emotional output into music. It’s this honesty that <strong>De Meyer</strong> expresses so freely, even when the tracks take a slicker angle, such as<em> Do You Remember</em>, an out-and-out piano ballad, that comes across far more <strong>Perfume Genius</strong> than <strong>Daniel Powter, </strong>and is all the more enjoyable for it. Check out a couple of my favourites from <em><strong>Hideaway</strong></em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3593076855/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3850627690/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17971-introducing-pauwel-de-meyer","category":"introducing","date":1348341468000,"wpid":17971,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":705,"height":706,"src":"2012/09/729358184-1.jpeg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMI/8QAHRAAAgICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMAAhESBCExIv/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A067kpSxdGtXW7LCtak9knzAlo0qfrUbeZx3Egv/Z"},"createdAt":1587284678309,"updatedAt":1588403536266,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/09/729358184-1.jpeg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
