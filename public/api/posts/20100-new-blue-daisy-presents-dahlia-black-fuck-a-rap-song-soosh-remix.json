Really enjoyable listen.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F80641939\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20100-new-blue-daisy-presents-dahlia-black-fuck-a-rap-song-soosh-remix","category":"music","date":1361804564000,"wpid":20100,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":534,"src":"2013/02/fuckarapsong-950x534.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUI/8QAIhAAAgECBQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFERIhMSNRcaHR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAD/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDPWA3oqXbi5prWbLW4YbNkDv549ye1o+o9Qc9j9iIpImivpU9EHf/Z"},"createdAt":1587283880291,"updatedAt":1588443769535,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/02/fuckarapsong-950x534.jpg","categories":["music","remixes","new","newnews"]}
