First release, the <strong><em>Weakend EP</em></strong> is a stunning collection of heart-wrenching serenades, personal highlight being the exquisitely elegant <em>Walk</em>. With a seven track cassette release around the corner, <strong>Oupa</strong> have made new song <em>Physical</em> available for streaming, as well as providing a resplendently handsome video to accompany the track.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2970842948/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://oupa.bandcamp.com/track/walk\">Walk by Yu(c)k</a></iframe></p>\n<p>Documenting what appears to be a night-time drive through a burning forest, with the faint outline of a teenage girl overlay-ed on top of the harrowing images of destruction, providing a startling contrast. Coming in at almost seven minutes,<em> Physical</em> is a courteous composition; restrained and purposefully delicate, relying heavily on the sublime vocals.
