Denmark’s <strong>Ninna Lundberg</strong> new (possibly debut) track <em>Fall Out Of Love</em> is a beautiful merging of folk and lo-fi influences, all centred around her rather fantastic vocal. So the production values are far from that of a chart hit, but that’s part of what makes it so endearing. Whereas the aforementioned faux-folk artists retreat into multi-million pound recording studios,<strong> Lundberg</strong> sounds like she’s recording in a basement or a bedroom. Check out<em> Fall Out Of Love</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2439202958/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23882-new-ninna-lundberg-fall-out-of-love","category":"mpfree","date":1376658031000,"wpid":23882,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":633,"src":"2013/08/0001720839_20-950x633.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIhAAAQMDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFIQYRIhIWIzGB/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIi/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDVta312JqGwwI7zqG1x3ZPBakAqSR077exhWDjNXe47U55A8sBXIAtnG/ylKj1pGFeS//Z"},"createdAt":1587283067592,"updatedAt":1588443767396,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/0001720839_20-950x633.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
