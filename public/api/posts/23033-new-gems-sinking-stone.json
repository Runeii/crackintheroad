New track<em> Sinking Stone</em> is possibly their most ambitious work so far, merging the shoegaze and dream pop influences that were so prominent on previous releases, with a slick, R&B tinge. Over halfway through 2013, and I’m still to find a new band that I’m as head over heels in love with as <strong>GEMS</strong>.
