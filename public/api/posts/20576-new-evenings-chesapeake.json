His follow up, taken from his next LP, <em>Yore</em>, is rather underwhelming in comparison, focusing on a stronger melody rather than textures or found sound. Regardless, it’s a new Evenings LP, we’re excited. Sream the new cut below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F85031231\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20576-new-evenings-chesapeake","category":"music","date":1364379402000,"wpid":20576,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283726741,"updatedAt":1588441767910,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/8573daa20fd9f5813f382555765f929252c08132.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
