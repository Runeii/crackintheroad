Fresh from supporting fellow countrymen <b>Shout Out Louds </b>on their U.S tour and<b> </b>plying his trade in Austin at SXSW, Stockholm resident <b>Linus Lutti</b> let us hear his project’s new song online<i> </i>at the end of last week.</p>\n<p>Apparently the track was recorded for American hospital drama <i>Grey’s Anatomy, </i>which might explain the slight step-up in production value – I have no idea what kind-of scene it’s been used in (one can probably rule out anything too uplifting), but thankfully there’s been no compromise on quality. It’s another confident display of <b>Lutti’s</b> thoughtful and emotive songwriting – rather than any TV show association, it should just go further in marking <b>Little Children </b>as a band to watch out for.
