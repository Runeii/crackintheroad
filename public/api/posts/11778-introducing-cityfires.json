Opening track <em>Chroniker</em> is an unashamedly pop influenced track, almost sounding like it should be sound-tracking a mid 90’s Disney film, with wistful lyrics and borderline cheesy vocals. Next up is the glitchy 8-bit stutter of <em>Remora</em>, very much fitting in with the classic ‘gameboy’ stereotype bandied about when discussing this genre. It’s almost danceable, although still quite possibly the weakest track on <strong><em>Canvas</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2628576858/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://cityfires.bandcamp.com/track/chroniker-demo\">Chroniker (demo) by Cityfires</a></iframe></p>\n<p>Again, the bipolar songwriting continues, opening up into the piano driven balladry of <em>The Photographer</em>, completed by orchestral violins and the vaguely <strong>Daniel Powter</strong>-esque (remember him?!) vocals. It’s on the last track however that <strong>Cityfires</strong> really excels; a minimal dubstep influenced affair, proving poetically ambient throughout. So with<em><strong> Canvas</strong></em>, <strong>Cityfires</strong> has shown his peculiarly diverse hand, and will hopefully follow up this EP with another more self-assured release.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3465289233/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://cityfires.bandcamp.com/track/sudden-dreams-of-ghosts-demo\">Sudden dreams of ghosts (demo) by Cityfires</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11778-introducing-cityfires","category":"album-reviews","date":1318633830000,"wpid":11778,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293702423,"updatedAt":1588441788345,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2737fa6172e34161ff1ffda0037.jpg","categories":["album-reviews","introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
