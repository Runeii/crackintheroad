Her <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/angelhazeym/gimme-that-prod-by-lunice\">collaboration</a> with the producer <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lunicefp\"><strong>Lunice</strong></a> was perhaps a highlight, a grandiose, stonking jam that cemented her as a firm ‘on to watch’ in 2013. In a year that started with <strong><a title=\"New: Azealia Banks – Aquababe (Produced by Machinedrum)\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/16927-new-azealia-banks-aquababe-produced-by-machinedrum/\">Azealia Banks</a></strong>, it’s encouraging to see a female MC end the year with a bit more substance. Her new cut/demo sees her take on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WcRXJ4piHg\"><strong>Chief Keef</strong>’s</a> ‘<em>I don’t like’</em>.
