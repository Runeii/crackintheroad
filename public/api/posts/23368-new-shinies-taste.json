In a time when UK guitar music is pretty much flat on its arse (Palma Violets, Peace, blah you know the rest),<strong> Shinies</strong> are a twinkling star of hope. Check out <em>Taste</em> below, and keep your eyes peeled for their EP, out 12 August.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F102127550\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23368-new-shinies-taste","category":"music","date":1374836200000,"wpid":23368,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283227831,"updatedAt":1588441763931,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/74292a0155904aa148fb470cae6e6cbbad2b659f.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
