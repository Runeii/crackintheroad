Featuring the likes of NME favourites Minotaurs, Moshi Moshi’s Clock Opera and Newcastle’s very own indie darlings Let’s Buy Happiness, Month Of Fridays will provide a platform for some of the finest up and coming acts around, and if you’re lucky you might even catch a couple of CitR writers showcasing a few chosen tracks.
