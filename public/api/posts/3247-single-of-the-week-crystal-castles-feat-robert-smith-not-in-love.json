Robert Smith – Not In Love","content":"<p><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Crystal Castles</strong>, a band that divide genres and split fan bases.</p><p> Their debut album was a huge disappointment for me, underwhelming and lacking the mystery that surrounds their epic live shows, however their most recent record, merely titled <em>II</em>, is a much welcome grandeur progression. So it was no surprise that their dark, all encompassing sound caught the ear of<strong> The Cure </strong>frontman<strong> Robert Smith</strong>, at which point he expressed his desire to perform on a remix of the duo’s upcoming single<em> Not In Love</em>. After recording the track with the legendary singer, it was decided that it was far too special to merely be wasted as a B-side, but would instead be the A-side to the release.</p>\n<p>So here it is, this catchy, anthemic song harks back to <em>Disintegration</em> era<strong> Cure</strong>, with Smith’s vocals adding a much welcome dimension to the<strong> Platinum Blonde</strong> cover. Landing somewhere between a haunted house ride soundtrack, and an 80’s dance hit,<em> Not In Love</em>, out on December 6th is one of my favourite tracks of the year.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\"></embed></object></p>\n<p><span> </span> <span> </span><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F6441083&secret_url=false\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F6441083&secret_url=false\"></embed></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/pigeonsandplanes/crystal-castles-not-in-love-ft-robert-smith\">Crystal Castles – Not In Love (ft.
