Ranging from the relatively experimental (dare I say chillwave inspired) <em>dusk</em>, to the ambient beauty of <em>tokyo</em>, not forgetting his latest release, <em>submarine</em>, a track that a twisted Arthur Beatrice would be proud of; there’s more than enough to suggest that he’s a mightily talented kid.
