Come September 12th, we see the drop of <em>‘Hex / Fatalist’</em> on 12″ vinyl through <strong>Untold’s Hemlock Recordings</strong> label.</p>\n<p><em>‘Hex’</em> combines jungle beats, old school breaks and rolling sub-bass with a choppy, repetitive vocal sample – a track sure to get people up and moving when dropped. Second track <em>‘Fatalist’</em> is a darker affair – a head-nodder with a liquid wobble, a snappy snare and an apt ‘LISTEN!’ vocal thrown in every now and again.</p>\n<p>Both tracks can be heard below via the <strong>Hemlock Soundcloud.</strong></p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"225\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1010817\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"225\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1010817\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hemlockrecordings/sets/hek013-pangaea\">HEK 013 – Pangaea</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hemlockrecordings\">Hemlockrecordings</a></span></p>\n","slug":"9737-new-pangaea-hex","category":"music","date":1313061232000,"wpid":9737,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/pangaea_032911-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwMI/8QAIxAAAgAEBQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIABAURAwYhQYESEyIxkf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AzBSlZp/BKoHCsGKsbAgexfaFs5noVzbL8sBsDLKSOevWDTLaK0vVGZVLJLqVJGqnuoNOCYoztc+R+wwP/9k="},"createdAt":1587294105796,"updatedAt":1588403551158,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d49","old_image":"2011/08/pangaea_032911-165x165.jpg","categories":["music"]}
