I can only describe the show as ‘eye-opening’, not because I felt they were doing anything dramatically different to their contemporaries, but because they were doing it so much better. At one point, Samantha grinded with an uncomfortable looking girl at the front of the stage and oozed with a level of sex appeal that was almost intimidating to witness at times.</p>\n<p>Since the end of their European tour things have become increasingly quiet when it comes to studio recordings, we were given a session recording of <a title=\"New: Friends – A Thing Like This\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/13759-new-friends-%e2%80%93-a-thing-like-this/\"><strong>‘<em>A Thing Like This’ </em></strong>a</a> few months back, but apart from that, nothing.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, vice’s sister site Noisey recorded a live cut of <em>‘Va Fan Gor Du’</em><em> </em>when they caught up with them at their XOYO show. <script src=\"https://player.ooyala.com/player.js?height=360&embedCode=BnczVvMzoPnMAefNaXFOAs3K0Ad77SHO&width=640&deepLinkEmbedCode=BnczVvMzoPnMAefNaXFOAs3K0Ad77SHO\"></script></p>\n<p><strong>“Hey, who do you think I am?
