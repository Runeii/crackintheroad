I remember hearing <em><strong>Daydream Nation</strong></em> when I was fifteen, having been introduced to them by my art teacher, and I instantly fell in love. Their radical songwriting, gritty sound and painstaking perfectionist attitude was unlike anything I’d heard prior to that point, and it knocked me off my feet.</p>\n<p>Five years on, and I still experience a similar overwhelmed feeling when listening to<em><strong> Goo</strong></em> or <em><strong>EVOL</strong></em>, whilst simultaneously constantly picking up on <strong>Sonic Youth</strong> influences amongst contemporary music. Los Angeles’s grit-pop outfit <strong>Sandy Yang</strong> appear to share a comparable connection with<strong> Sonic Youth</strong>, displayed affectionately on their six track demo EP. From the rumbling drum beat of opener <em>Ideals,</em> to the bass heavy outro instrumental outro piece, it’s an accomplished, thoroughly engrossing selection of tracks. Switching between frenetic and overzealous, to languid and dreamy (<em>Ruins</em>), <strong>Sandy Yang</strong> achieve a grungy lo-fi aesthetic that numerous contemporary artists aspire to and ultimately fail to find.</p>\n<p>Check out a couple of my choice picks below, and stream the whole EP via their <a href=\"https://sandyyang.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F38475808%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-P4bWM&show_artwork=true&secret_url=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F38475651%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-0u3KE&show_artwork=true&secret_url=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15459-introducing-sandy-yang","category":"introducing","date":1330707305000,"wpid":15459,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":197,"src":"2012/03/3954158283-1-165x197.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAMAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAX/xAAiEAACAQQCAQUAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAUREhMGISMxQZH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/8QAGREBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACESEx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAXkGfskiB7WkmS5lJRWIBQDX6Cd1Ijs8o8atHk4uBAK+4firGQwOPvrmbuh11ySheB16FjuhribSJRGsZ4oOI2foUGEdRyw9J//9k="},"createdAt":1587292720025,"updatedAt":1588443775333,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/3954158283-1-165x197.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
