Addressing the all too real issues of complicated adolescence, alongside attempting to find an identity within a society that at times, offers few answers, it’s not too far from the likes of The 1975 or Magic Man. Following on from a colossal UK tour featuring a vast majority of sold out dates, Orla Gartland plays three SXSW shows this week, including one at <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20229-announcement-citr-x-disco-naivete-present-dark-paradise-sxsw\" target=\"_blank\">B.D Riley’s</a> and an official showcase at Maggie Mae’s tomorrow night.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/195763998%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-dLc9G&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>3/18, 11p at Music From Ireland showcase, Maggie Mae’s Gibson Room, 512 Trinity St</i></span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><i></i><span class=\"s2\"><i>3/20, 11:35a at Irish Breakfast at B.D.
