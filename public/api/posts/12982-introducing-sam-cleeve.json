I’ve been sitting on these tracks from Reading producer <strong>Sam Cleeve</strong> for a couple of weeks now, trying to work out how to convert the beauteous simplicity of his music into logical and insightful scripture.</p>\n<p>Relying heavily upon repeated piano sections,<strong> Cleeve</strong> conjures up stunning soundscapes, aided greatly by his impeccable production. The sumptuous <em>Metropolis</em> swirls majestically before slipping effortlessly into the epic <em>Halogen</em>, combining classical inspirations with drone and ambient tendencies. It’s also refreshing to see <strong>Sam Cleeve</strong> taking an innovative approach with the release, packing each CD in a recycled sleeve with handwritten notes, tracklisting and a unique photo taken from the 1940s/50. Check out a couple of choice picks tomorrow, and head over to <strong>Sam Cleeve’s</strong> <a href=\"https://samcleeve.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> to grab the full release of <em><strong>Foundation Studies</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1989100218/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe><br />\n<iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2609322138/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12982-introducing-sam-cleeve","category":"introducing","date":1323096202000,"wpid":12982,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/12/2070883224-1-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEB//EACYQAAIBAwMBCQAAAAAAAAAAAAECBAADBRESMRQhIkFRUmFxgZH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwA4xYImLJkXeovmUjrbRtgKbT7nXXs548jVdzMYNrjMMHIAJJ0EhgB9eFY1FZgZGhI75PPzS729R/aiGv/Z"},"createdAt":1587293335162,"updatedAt":1588443776981,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/12/2070883224-1-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
