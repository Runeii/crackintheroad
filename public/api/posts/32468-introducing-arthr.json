UK musician and animator <strong>Arthr</strong> epitomises this – with his debut EP, <strong><em>Reliving of Scenes</em></strong>, coming complete with stunning visuals for lead track <em>Context Unavailable</em>. Music wise, the influences appear relatively easy to pin down – we’re talking the likes of Boards of Canada, Tycho, maybe even the likes of Bonobo and The Orb as well at moments. Above all, it’s the ambition and artistry that really stand out, and make Arthr such an exciting project. Check out the video below, alongside another track lifted from the release.</p>\n<p>Like this?
