Since then they have had a top 15 hit in the UK charts with single <strong>Opposite of Adults</strong>, a remix of last years hit single Kids from American electro band <strong>MGMT</strong>. Towards the end of 2009 <strong>Chiddy Bang</strong> released a mixtape titled <strong>The Swelly Express</strong>, which featured almost all of their recorded tracks so far. In preparation for their debut album, they are giving away another mini-mixtape titled <strong>Air Swell</strong>, a continuation from last years compilation. It is very much a case of picking up where they left off, including the skits which document their travelling from the US to the UK.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">This mixtape cements <strong>Chiddy Bang</strong> as one of the hottest rap groups in the world at the moment, and it is no surprise that they have numerous record labels chasing them. <strong>Under The Sheets </strong>is a highlight, along with the remix they provided for a b-side to <strong>Gorillaz</strong> recent single <strong>Stylo</strong>. Other songs include fantastic samples of <strong>Kate Nash</strong> and <strong>Hot Chip</strong>, which emphasis even more how on top of their music they are at the moment, few groups can mix styles which such devastatingly brilliant effects.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Download the mixtape for free from <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/prettymuchamazing.com\">Pretty Much Amazing</a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?2j1mz3mhwth\">Under The Sheets</a></div>\n","slug":"45-chiddy-bang","category":"music","date":1270891380000,"wpid":45,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/06/l_d6f8ea3105224e9fa3f87960966954a4-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587295378871,"updatedAt":1588403569278,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/l_d6f8ea3105224e9fa3f87960966954a4-188x188.jpg","categories":["music"]}
