One of the groups most notable qualities is their arresting diversity, swerving between gentle murmurings and grand chorus sections at the flick of a switch.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F31760761&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Standout track <em>In Limbo</em> is one of the most atmospheric pop masterpieces you’ll hear in 2012, with it’s sturdy bass line, steady percussion and swirling guitars gradually falling into line with one another, building to a transcendental crescendo. <strong>Kinnie The Explorer</strong> embody the folk-pop capabilities of <strong>Fleet Foxes</strong>, coupled with the elegant ambiance of <strong>Radiohead</strong>, without coming across as naive nor forced.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33461510&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p>At ten tracks in total, it’s nigh on perfect in length, neither dragging on or indeed ending abruptly. Another of the records highlights is the fluttering <em>Nautilus</em>, a track that’s almost unbearably texturally deep, and a wholly intoxicating listen, running into the dauntingly powerful<em> Crowds And Power</em>. With their debut LP, <strong>Kinnie The Explorer</strong> have actualized the sum of many years experiences and handwork, making for one of the years hidden gems.</p>\n<p><strong>Kinnie The Explorer </strong>is out now on <a href=\"https://www.alcohollabel.com/product/kinnie-the-explorer\" target=\"_blank\">Alcohol Label</a>.</p>\n","slug":"16026-review-kinnie-the-explorer-in-limbo","category":"album-reviews","date":1334862423000,"wpid":16026,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2012/04/184315_204197096262876_111729935509593_863658_4867922_n-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwUG/8QAIxAAAgEEAQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAwURIQAGEkEUInGBkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAGxEBAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxIRIXH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AAnp+FF7FWZJSirUu4u2wM6x+ZP1zTR7FdHj0mi3C1vQKg029ai5XGjg7GvB3w6tpJlxFJJUsmR45Lc+9vngSydPEmYcLZ3pt7P/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587292538457,"updatedAt":1588443774654,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/04/184315_204197096262876_111729935509593_863658_4867922_n-165x165.jpg","categories":["album-reviews","music"]}
