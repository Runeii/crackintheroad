Her music is quite distant, otherworldly in parts, yet startlingly beautiful. Take the transcendent <em>We Are Birds</em>, or the more upbeat, EP opener <em>Asia</em>, there’s a colossal variety in her sound, and one that’s purposefully hard to pin down. For now, Cristin Young appears as somewhat of an enigma, a majestic one at that. Stream <em>We Are Birds</em> below, and the EP in full underneath that.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2987079042/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/t=3/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2987079042/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27929-introducing-cristin-young","category":"introducing","date":1397600941000,"wpid":27929,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282215566,"updatedAt":1587825850275,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
