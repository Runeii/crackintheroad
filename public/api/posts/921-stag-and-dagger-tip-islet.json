Witnessing them playing with<strong> Los Campesinos! </strong>a couple of months back, I can honestly say it was one of the most invigorating and enjoyable performances from a support band I have ever seen. Starting the set in the crowd, and combining high pitched shrieked vocals with an inventive and wide ranged usage of instruments, they were the perfect remedy to get the crowd going for the headline act. Not only are they original and quirky, with their own unique style of performing, they also continuously swapped instruments, almost every song in fact, showing the real talent and strength contained inside this young band from Cardiff. Whether or not you enjoy their <strong>Animal Collective</strong> influenced mayhem of sound, there is no doubt in my mind that <strong>Islet </strong>will be a captivating and intriguing watch for anyone at <strong>Stag and Dagger</strong> this Saturday.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.staganddagger.com/\">Buy Tickets For Stag And Dagger</a></p>\n","slug":"921-stag-and-dagger-tip-islet","category":"festivals","date":1274378329000,"wpid":921,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1024,"height":709,"src":"2011/06/islet_photo1-1024x709.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIH/8QAIhAAAQIFBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFERIGISIxExSh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQP/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMV0ZWpAvvyWpWXV0p1nEeueQUFp+EApNt97xFVqFBbqk4iRl3zKJeWGT5VDhkcexfq0IRQrclX/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587295257828,"updatedAt":1588403567596,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/islet_photo1-1024x709.jpg","categories":["festivals","music"]}
