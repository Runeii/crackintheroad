Sasha Go Hard released her new mixtape, <i>Round 3.</p><p> </i>It’s an eleven track collection of unadulterated fun, with one foot firmly on the dance floor. Beats on the release are provided, among others, by Diplo and Absolut P, while Le1f and Kreayshawn furnish it with some guest verses. Have yourself a bouncy Wednesday and head over to <a title=\"Sasha Go Hard - Round 3\" href=\"https://www.datpiff.com/Sasha-Go-Hard-Round-3-mixtape.451069.html\" target=\"_blank\">datpiff.com</a> to download it.</p>\n<p>Fancy a little bit more of the charismatic character?
