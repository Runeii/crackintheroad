In and around all that, he’s pushed out collaborations (<strong>Kids In Tracksuits</strong>, <strong>Kona Triangle</strong>), snuck out some more tracks here and there on Amsterdam’s Dekmantel, Manchester’s Hoya:Hoya, and <strong>Boys Noize</strong>‘s Boysnoize Records, and remixed everyone – namely <strong>Tensnake</strong>, <strong>Underworld</strong>, <strong>Bibio</strong>, <strong>Chilly Gonzales</strong>, <strong>Friendly Fires</strong>, <strong>Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs</strong>, <strong>The Count & Sinden</strong>, CitR favourites <strong>Solar Bears</strong>, and of course, <strong>Radiohead</strong>.</p>\n<p>Having said that, he’s still got a lot of steam left in him – his adventures with R&S continue, this year starting with new single <em>Crystal Caverns 1991</em>, due out on 26th March (backed with B-side <em>Vulcan Mill Acid</em>). This being the first single for his forthcoming album <em>Galaxy Garden</em> (due 30th April), it shows a lot of promise. The familiarity of <strong>Lone</strong> productions is there (distorted melodies, incessant drums) is throw up in the air by the use of a playful rave element only teased with before. Harking back to the ’90’s (not so subtly, considering the track’s title), his music still manages to retain the exotic nostalgia he’s expressed in the past, but with a similar bite to his peer <strong>Rustie</strong> – in fact, I’m hoping this album will build on the excitement and innovation set up by last year’s <em>Glass Swords</em>.</p>\n<p>R&S may be offering a lot from their newest roster – new singles from <strong>James Blake </strong>and <strong>Bullion</strong>, and another soon from <strong>Pariah</strong> – but <strong>Lone</strong> looks to be their biggest bet yet. <em>Galaxy Garden</em> will feature vocal spots from both <strong>Machinedrum</strong> and recent <strong>Planet Mu</strong> go-to <strong>Anneka</strong>, but this is the titular character’s solo time. The man is simply <em>killing</em> it.</p>\n<p><em>Check new Lone single Crystal Caverns 1991 below</em>.</p>\n<p><center><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36698294&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true&color=000000\"></iframe></center></p>\n","slug":"15260-new-lone-crystal-caverns-1991","category":"music","date":1329923405000,"wpid":15260,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":950,"src":"2012/02/lone-950x950.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587292776541,"updatedAt":1588443775650,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2012/02/lone-950x950.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
