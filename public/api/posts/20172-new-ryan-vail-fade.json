A slow-burner that explodes into life towards it’s final couple of minutes, it’s elegant and wonderfully considered; it’s the musical equivalent of those cold-nights when you can see your own breath.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F80085137\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20172-new-ryan-vail-fade","category":"music","date":1361993833000,"wpid":20172,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283855970,"updatedAt":1588441769426,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/e14d23fcaffc29005ee0b19580419549c3522d9d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
