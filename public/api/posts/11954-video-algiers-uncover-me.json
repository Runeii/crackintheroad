Goodwin. The former once played bass and sang in much-missed Northern indie-pop types Dartz!, and the latter was the drummer for…erm…much-missed Northern indie-pop types The Maple State. Luckily, after a chance meeting at Sheffield University, the pair have combined their already considerable powers (with Anderson switching to guitar) and formed Algiers, to create some damn fine…ah…Northern indie-pop.</p>\n<p>In all seriousness, though, the twosome’s debut EP <strong><em>Four Priests</em></strong> is out on Monday, and to mark the occasion, here’s the video to the track <em>Uncover Me</em>, lifted off said EP. As you’ll soon find out, Algiers make the kind of bittersweet, bookish, and infinitely tuneful racket that lifts the pair firmly out of the shadow of their previous outfits and into their own gloriously grin-inducing territory. ‘I think that I’ll be fine without you’? Yep, judging by this, I’m pretty sure we all will.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBbi6LN5J8U\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong><em>Four Priests </em></strong>is out on October 24th via <a href=\"https://www.bsmrocks.com/main.html\">Big Scary Monsters</a>.
