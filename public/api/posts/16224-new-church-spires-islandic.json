I was pretty stoked on today as it was, and then <strong>Blackbird Blackbird</strong> decided to go and make it all even more delicious by dropping the first track off his side project, <strong><a href=\"https://churchspires.bandcamp.com/\">Church Spires.</a></strong></p>\n<p>Centered around a central reverberating melody, the cut creates has a striking resemblance to the brief moment between afternoon and night, the exact moment we’re all experiencing right now. A sudden gear change; breathing in to relax, breathing out in excitement.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=858791762/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16224-new-church-spires-islandic","category":"music","date":1335549057000,"wpid":16224,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":670,"height":436,"src":"2012/04/church-spires.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAIBAAAQQCAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQGETEFElFhcf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAHBEAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMBBAAFBiFh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDC6Lmde/SJjqSdw53rz99hRkylrZHNNQggkchESLbWlFMQWUO45QtqBjA78z//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587291217082,"updatedAt":1588403539919,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/04/church-spires.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
