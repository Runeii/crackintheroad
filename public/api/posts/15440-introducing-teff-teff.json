Composed of singer <strong>Aoife O’Leary</strong> and <strong>Ryuji Morita</strong>, their three debut demo tracks are wonderfully languid home-produced dreampop inspired affairs, with nostalgic synths and steady percussion sections all rounded off by <strong>O’Leary’s</strong> sumptuously dreamy vocals.</p>\n<p>At times there’s a warming realism to their music, as the instrumental and vocal parts seem to diverge, before joining up again further along their course. Comparisons could easily be drawn to the aforementioned <strong>Keep Shelly In Athens</strong>, however there’s a more 90’s, <strong>Cocteau Twins</strong> atmospheric undertow to <strong>Teff-Teff’s</strong> music.
