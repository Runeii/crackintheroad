I should’ve known. That <a title=\"\"All freezing stars and limitless black expanse\", I think I said once. \" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/koreless/htdw-cold-nites-koreless-remix\">How To Dress Well remix</a> smashed up the template a treat, pitching Tom Krell low like Nina Simone and stripping <em>Cold Nites </em>of all its beats and drama. Only power left behind.</p>\n<p><em>Sun</em>, lead track from forthcoming EP <em><strong>Yugen</strong></em>, <em> </em>largely keeps drums off the table, too. Roberts has been working on his synths, that much is plain, looping little solar flares over a Vangelisy, orbital chord movement, building and building, turning the loops into the teasing semblance of a beat. When the stutter that opens <em>Sun</em> comes in again at 4:16, a bare, tripping memory of the lush vocal work that characterised early Koreless releases…Jesus. It all makes sense.</p>\n<p>Because what does the Sun do, if not come up?</p>\n<p>Preorder <em><strong>Yugen</strong></em><strong> </strong>from <a title=\"Today has been a good day. \" href=\"https://theyoungturks.co.uk/\">Young Turks.</a></p>\n","slug":"21311-new-koreless-sun","category":"music","date":1366318207000,"wpid":21311,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":625,"src":"2013/04/koreless-950x625.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQGMQURIUGR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAZEQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMAESH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMPhxHjBgdLJLN+drZrJrursj7d4cQSDrQ9qbkpccJHBlyctBPRMI19RFZOC0XpxhyPN/9k="},"createdAt":1587283601254,"updatedAt":1588443769034,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2013/04/koreless-950x625.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
