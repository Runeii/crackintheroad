Their first single to drop from their 2012 LP, <strong><em>Amanaemonesia</em></strong>, was a luscious and surrealist wonder. A hard track to follow, yet <strong><em>‘Sidewalk Safari’</em></strong> makes it look frighteningly easy. Full of 80’s goofball like synths, and that charming as fuck voice of Polachek’s makes this record just as exciting as it’s former. The album can’t come soon enough.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25824792\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25824792\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"11970-new-chairlift-sidewalk-safari","category":"music","date":1319214715000,"wpid":11970,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293662829,"updatedAt":1588441787905,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/103c030de25759eb1a4c7d092d4c57b119141a58.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
