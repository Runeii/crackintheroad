Far more soulful, and dare I say it innovative than the likes of Tom Odell, Lay Me Down is both understated and fantastically over-the-top (‘<em>you told me not to cry when you were gone</em>‘). In truth, it’s far closer to <strong>Boyz II Men</strong> than it is to the house-pop of Disclosure.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76738498\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19327-new-sam-smith-lay-me-down","category":"music","date":1359328690000,"wpid":19327,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284087368,"updatedAt":1588441771314,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/f9c59fff374544fb32293622bd8fce042c2756b4.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
