Steffaloo)","content":"<p>It seems that everyone wants to work with <strong><a href=\"https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/pages/Steffaloo/155903334466563?\">Steffaloo</a></strong> at the moment. From her work with <strong><a title=\"New: Chrome Sparks – My\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/9160-new-chrome-sparks-my/\">Chrome Sparks</a></strong>, to her debut collaborative LP under name <strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/toycamera/sets/blissful-youth-ep\">Toy Camera</a></strong> and finally this new release with <strong><a href=\"https://dannielradall.bandcamp.com\">DannielRadall</a></strong>, it very clear that the girl has a voice that inspires people.</p>\n<p>The new single from the two artists takes a bold new direction for <strong>Steffaloo</strong>, the heavily 80’s inspired track isn’t perhaps what we know her for, yet it’s a sound she adopts with an exciting level of grace. Soulful and sexy, her voice is shrouded in a silk like level of reverb that utterly seductive to the ear.</p>\n<p>The production by <strong>DannielRadall</strong> surrounding the vocals, are joyously mental yet still centered in the stylistic direction. Fuzzy synths and an utterly infectious bass line form the roots of the track, with a funky guitar riff around the hook elevating the track to the levels of hyper activeness, but wonderfully so.</p>\n<p>Check out the track, as well as the B-side from CITR fave Sun <strong>Glitters</strong> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1687073571/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11487-new-dannielradall-to-make-you-mine-feat-steffaloo","category":"music","date":1316787134000,"wpid":11487,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/to-make-you-mine-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587293778638,"updatedAt":1588403547053,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/09/to-make-you-mine-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
