G. Cook</strong>, and apparently through XL Recordings (produced by Diplo…?), it’s surfaced online as part of their Boilerroom set earlier this week. A nine minute long mindfuck with a four minute spoken word intro, it’s unlike anything you’ve ever heard before, and that’s a guarantee. Skip to 4.30 to hear the song itself, or if you’ve got the time, bask in the genius of the entire composition.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/164385280&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29598-new-qt-hey-qt","category":"music","date":1408972567000,"wpid":29598,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281958235,"updatedAt":1588441754594,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/de7804e485499fb93165fb84bb6d655232c561e2.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
