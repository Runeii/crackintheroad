Grandfather Birds have done just that, recording under/on top of no fewer than five different bridges, thus bringing about the aptly titled Higher Bridges. The track itself is an epic indie number; showcasing why it’s a standout track from their live sets. A memorable riff, accompanied by a heartfelt, engaging chorus, allow the track to perfectly mirror the video. A black and white performance film, displaying Grand Father Birds in session, playing Higher Bridges, set to a projected background of flashing images and short clips of their beloved hometown Newcastle.
