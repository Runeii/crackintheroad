{"id":"5e9c087f774c2610387e5049","artists":["5e9b68ec7a1236eccfeb1fbc"],"title":"New: Døden – Afasi / Apraksi","content":"<p>Norway is the most beautiful country in the world.</p><p> Well, certainly out of all places that I’ve been to, Norway is right up at at the top; from the rolling expanses of greenery, to the halcyon beaches, not to mention the wealth of attractive females. Norwegian outfit <strong>Døden</strong> encapsulate two of those traits, with their composed debut tracks <em>Afasi</em> and <em>Apraksi</em>. Now here’s where my rather limited knowledge of drone lets me down, but there’s hints of <strong>Aphex Twin’s</strong> <strong><i>Selected Ambient Works Volume II </i></strong>and of course, king of drone, <strong>Tim Hecker</strong>. Strap your headphones on, turn it up loud, and just listen.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=4006675836/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19314-new-doden-afasi-apraksi","category":"mpfree","date":1359126875000,"wpid":19314,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284095387,"updatedAt":1588441771369,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/02dc4bf883736095757701dfb28acc40f5df8216.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
