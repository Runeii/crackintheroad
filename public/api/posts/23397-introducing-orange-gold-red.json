With the pop sensibilities of the likes of <strong>Robyn</strong> or<strong> Ellie Goulding</strong>, and the quirky production more in line with <strong>Grimes</strong> or <strong>Purity Ring</strong>, their two debut tracks are rather gorgeous. There’s the brash, out-and-out pop of <em>Figure Eights,</em> and the more refined, reserved, but no less beautiful wistful nature of <em>Ink</em>, where Gregory takes up backing vocals. Whilst it’s clear that <strong>Orange Red Gold</strong> is still very much in its infancy, these two tracks are an extremely promising sign of what’s to come.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3174561849/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23397-introducing-orange-gold-red","category":"introducing","date":1374872812000,"wpid":23397,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283215796,"updatedAt":1588441763809,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/760748ee5ff571af3013eba2fa0f980a5ab31379.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
