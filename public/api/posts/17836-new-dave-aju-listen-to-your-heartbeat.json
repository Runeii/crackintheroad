Well we are now), San Francisco producer <strong>Dave Aju’s</strong> new EP entitled<strong><em> Listen To Your Heartbeat</em></strong> will make you prance your little socks off. Take the title track, a six minute psychedelic seizure, that’s as unique as it is totally enthralling. Choppy percussion sections and breathy vocals contrast splendidly, forming a trippy hip-hop influenced sound, with a chorus that grows catchier with every listen. With his new EP out in ten days on <a href=\"accidentalrecords.com\" target=\"_blank\">Accidental Records</a>, this is a release you’re going to want to wrap your ears around.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F56408728&secret_token=s-53vmz\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17836-new-dave-aju-listen-to-your-heartbeat","category":"music","date":1347018330000,"wpid":17836,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":600,"src":"2012/09/201009251943536072.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYI/8QAHhABAAICAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMEAAIGIQURYTH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE/8QAGBEBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIABCH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALi/wZOGS+WoSQyX5oNVdfYbJ+vfw+d5nm1Qua2ptWuCbohIdd4xhOe2VMoks93/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284740237,"updatedAt":1588403536856,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/09/201009251943536072.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
