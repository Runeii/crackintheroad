With it’s otherworldly sounds and organic ambient nature, it’s kind of like <strong>Balam Acab</strong> meets <strong>Baths</strong>. The softly delivered vocals add a welcome layer of emotion to the tracks, such as the stunning <em>Half Breath</em> with it’s barely audible lyrics. Elsewhere on the EP the seven minute epic <em>Venus Breath</em> is wonderfully atmospheric, with it’s dreamy vocals and trance influenced synths, and EP closer <em>Orphius</em> is gorgeously entrancing, seducing the listener into a sensual lull.</p>\n<p>With the EP available as a free download from<strong> The Soft’s</strong> <a href=\"https://thesoft.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> page, and a rapidly growing fanbase, you can guarantee that this won’t be the last we hear of the Suffolk trio.
