Comprised of <strong>Angus James</strong> and <strong>Oliver James</strong> (presumably relatives or some sort – brothers/cousins?), the two tracks in question are glorious slices of candy-floss pop, melting in the ears like Aero bubbles on the tongue. <em>Don’t Hang Around</em> is somewhere between the <strong>Beach Boys</strong> and<strong> The Drums</strong>, with it’s tales of unrequited love pitted against quilt-soft harmonies.<em> “I’m in love with a girl who’s in love with a girl who’s in love with the boy next door / he’s in love with himself wants nobody else, I’m not going to take it no more”</em> may well be the most twee line penned in 2013, and given that we’re only hours into the year, I can assure you I understand just how bold a claim that may appear to be. If this is <strong>The Death Of Pop</strong>, then bring it on. Check out <em>Don’t Hang Around</em> and <em>Nowhere</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73306179\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73306027\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18908-introducing-the-death-of-pop","category":"introducing","date":1357091013000,"wpid":18908,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284273458,"updatedAt":1588441772310,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ea7fa5dc98b8d26a21cf31ddc6357143f77cca90.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
