This massive gleaming structure of sparkle filled with the pinkest inflatable flamingos and twinkling floor tiles dazzle the senses and turns anyone and everyone into a squealing little girl as soon as a step is taken inside.</p>\n<p><b>Amy Exton’s</b> work is not what it loudly says on the shiniest tin. With the flashy first impression comes some intriguing aesthetic, contextual and textural associations to some prominent tinsel based practices.</p>\n<p>The use of polished and reflective materials to surround an object or figurine to highlight its significance has been a go-to exhibiting method for hundreds of years, and has been used for religious idols standing in an alcove laden with light and shiny flecks to Elvis standing on a stage sporting rhinestone covered suits. Amy has exploited contemporary art’s attachment to exclusivity to bring integrity back to these tasteless materials and elevate them back to a status that they are and can be seen in all over the world. Coupled with this more serious note, the lasting sense of fun and entertainment is also injected into the installation, you can’t help but feel inexplicably happy when surrounded by a glitzy décor. They don’t call Las Vegas ‘America’s Playground’ for nothing.</p>\n<p>For Amy’s website click <a href=\"https://www.amyexton.com/\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p>Alongside her artistic endeavours, Amy is also planning to launch a furniture design label <b>Glittergunz. </b>We’ll definitely be keeping our eyes peeled for that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-46-04/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-22337\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22337\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.04.png\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.04.png 435w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.04-224x300.png 224w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.04-37x50.png 37w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" /></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-45-42/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-22336\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22336\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.45.42.png\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.45.42.png 438w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.45.42-225x300.png 225w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.45.42-37x50.png 37w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" /></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-46-43/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-22339\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22339\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.43.png\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.43.png 881w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.43-300x200.png 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.43-50x33.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 881px) 100vw, 881px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-46-57/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-22341\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22341\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.57.png\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.57.png 442w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.57-226x300.png 226w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.57-38x50.png 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" /></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-47-26/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-22343\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22343\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.47.26.png\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.47.26.png 436w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.47.26-220x300.png 220w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.47.26-37x50.png 37w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" /></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"22335-artist-profile-amy-exton","category":"arts","date":1370377432000,"wpid":22335,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283425858,"updatedAt":1587825870849,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d17","categories":["arts"]}
