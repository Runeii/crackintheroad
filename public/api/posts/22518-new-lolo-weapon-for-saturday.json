Again, I’m hesitant to draw the comparison, but there’s aspects of the ‘don’t take no shit’ vibe given off by the likes of Lana Del Rey, Fergie and even P!nk (shout out to the latter, first ever CitR mention), yet with a rougher, more true to roots hip-hop vibe. All things considered, it’s a mightily bold and extravagant first outing, sure to turn numerous heads.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F96777865\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22518-new-lolo-weapon-for-saturday","category":"music","date":1371222809000,"wpid":22518,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":797,"src":"2013/06/1004744_464675436958621_850506044_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAeEAACAgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEAAUGERMhkf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAZEQADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRITH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AI8hrUt+WLl2Z4xCgkgXqZ1eRVBUHjwAkZKksXdQdrksMkclg9zIqnhS3pA+4xgoWsjL4j//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283396180,"updatedAt":1588403529708,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/06/1004744_464675436958621_850506044_n.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
