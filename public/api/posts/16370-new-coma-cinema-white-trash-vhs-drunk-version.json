This new demo taken from said forthcoming album is described as <strong>Cothran</strong> as being <em>‘about the time I was almost murdered and every thing that happened because of that’. </em>Record whilst in a state of intoxication, it’s everything we’ve grown to love from <strong>Coma Cinema</strong>; raw, emotional and scarily real. Check out <em>White Trash VHS</em> below and the tracklisting for <em><strong>School Shootings</strong></em> under that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F45415603&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>White Trash VHS</li>\n<li>School Shootings</li>\n<li>Warm Wolves Milking Mary</li>\n<li>Survivor’s Guilt</li>\n<li>Partners In Crime</li>\n<li>Virgin Veins</li>\n<li>Leaking House</li>\n<li>Hurt Everything</li>\n<li>Hotter Sadness</li>\n<li>Lee</li>\n<li>Columbine High Harmony</li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"16370-new-coma-cinema-white-trash-vhs-drunk-version","category":"music","date":1336240499000,"wpid":16370,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587289724617,"updatedAt":1588441778501,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/05/no_target_shooting-165x123.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
