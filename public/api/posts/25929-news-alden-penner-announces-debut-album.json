Now it is fucking 2014 and I’m reaching the age where I should be considered a grown-up. It’s daunting, it’s depressing and frankly I’m not ready.</p>\n<p>Right on cue and like the ghost of Christmas past, Alden Penner, founding member of The Unicorns emerged from the woodwork of Montreal’s finest maple in December 2013 with <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/25595-stream-alden-penner-precession-ep/\">a new EP</a>. Today he announced his debut album, Exegesis, will be released on the 4th of February.</p>\n<p>According to a press release, Exegesis has been a work in progress for the last few years. It was recorded at Alden Penner’s home with borrowed equipment, and in a studio with friend and Grammy-award winning engineer Mark Lawson.</p>\n<p>What the press release failed to mention is that <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lawson-mn0000005317\">Mark Lawson</a> contributed to the production on the Arcade Fire’s latest release ‘Reflektor’, Beirut’s ‘Flying Cup Club’, The Unicorn’s ‘Who Will Cut Our Hair When We’re Gone’ and a plethora of other mind-blowing records. This puts Exegesis up there with some of the finest indie records of the last ten years. No pressure then Alden.</p>\n<p>I’m on tenterhooks for this album and what I’ve heard so far sounds promising.</p>\n<p>It also proves that ten years isn’t very long after all and, in the fleeting time we spend on this earth, there are only certain artists (and I use the term artist very deliberately) that can pull through and stick with us throughout it all.</p>\n<p>See the full track listing below and stream Alden Penner’s latest EP <a href=\"www.crackintheroad.com/music/25595-stream-alden-penner-precession-ep/\">here</a>.
