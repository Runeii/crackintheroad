This internet-wide scavenger hunt for the unreleased tracks taken from upcoming album <em>Fragrant World</em> has, predictably, been solved rather quickly. Whilst half a dozen songs are still missing, four – ‘Blue Paper’, ‘No Bones’, ‘Reagan’s Skeleton’ and ‘Damaged Goods’ have already been found, and we’ve got them for you below. There’s nothing particularly surprising, and the <strong>Yeasayer </strong>hallmarks are all there, but the step away from pop and into the slightly more psychedelic should keep interest heightened whilst the rest of the tracks are hunted down.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>the entire album is now up on YouTube. The playlist is below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLAD36EA8517288BEE&hl=en_GB\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The album’s tracklisting is as follows:</p>\n<p>1.
