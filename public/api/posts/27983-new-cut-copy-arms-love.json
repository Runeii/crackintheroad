This is truly cinematic, widescreen pop, built for days like today. Roll down your windows and blast this track while the sun lasts and drift into longing for the festival season thats right around the corner…</p>\n<p><em>In These Arms Of Love</em> is out today and is limited to just 2000 copies.</p>\n<p><strong>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141799527″ params=”auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true” width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /]</strong></p>\n","slug":"27983-new-cut-copy-arms-love","category":"music","date":1398089224000,"wpid":27983,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282195064,"updatedAt":1588441758320,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"generated/d86f1d81a82bc926ace908cacb6fd37d338e4100.jpg","categories":["music","newnews"]}
