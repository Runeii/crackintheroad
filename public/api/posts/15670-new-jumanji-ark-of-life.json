I love when the kid turns into a werewolf, and Robin Williams doesn’t seem remotely fussed by it, and who can forget the animals stampeding through a plush suburban household? New York’s <strong>JUMANJI</strong> may have the name, but aside from that, bare little resemble to the 1995 classic, yet they’re still just as awesome.</p><p></p>\n<p><em>Ark Of Life</em> is a wonderfully lo-fi number, appearing lackluster on first listen, however flourishing on repeated hearings. A drum machine keeps a steady pace whilst reverb drowned guitars are plucked languidly over the top, which when combined with the drawled vocals makes for a thoroughly compelling listen. <em>‘Because I’ll probably die before I’m 25, I’ll never fall in love I’ll never get to be your bride’</em> bemoans the lead singer in a remorseful albeit slightly sarcastic manner. They may not be quite as extravagant nor as starstudded as the film, but with <em>Ark of Life</em> <strong>JUMANJI</strong> have rolled the die and it’s Yahtzee’s all round.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3049462464/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://soundsfromjumanji.bandcamp.com/track/ark-of-life\">Ark of life by JUMANJI</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15670-new-jumanji-ark-of-life","category":"mpfree","date":1331930715000,"wpid":15670,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292657628,"updatedAt":1588441780014,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273594259b33ebf4e76cf610f41.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
