There’s hints of Yeasayer and Vampire Weekend in the songwriting, be it the sombre drawl of <em>You’re Traditional</em> or the more upbeat groove of <em>Young</em>. Check out the full EP below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 626px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4116823724/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24636-introducing-gawls","category":"introducing","date":1381926153000,"wpid":24636,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282873120,"updatedAt":1588441761723,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/eb8f35e4710a4715615f79e6a720952843d2a7c6.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
