New cut, <em>Ivory</em>, is destined for similar online success, and while it doesn’t even begin to touch on the beauty or genius of either of the aforementioned artists, there’s more than enough here to suggest Movement have enough in their lockers to be around for some time to come. Ivory is lifted from their self-titled EP, out 6 May through Modular.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/145077584&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"28010-new-movement-ivory","category":"music","date":1398123702000,"wpid":28010,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282191543,"updatedAt":1588441758240,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/9df4fa9646add9205d60c393fbcaa4a8f7e14470.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
