I could just as easily imagine Amy Winehouse singing this, as could Pharrell. Check out Killed Ya below, lifted from an EP out later in September.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/162098560&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29402-new-daniel-wilson-killed-ya","category":"music","date":1407515225000,"wpid":29402,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281994622,"updatedAt":1588441755159,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/b239ba039459e8ac85e2e4e38da2fb19f194c9c7.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
