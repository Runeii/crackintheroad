Started primarily as the recording project of Nathan Williams, the group have experienced highs and lows in their career to date, including drug induced on stage melt downs and in band fights. Earlier this week Nathan premiered a brand new track, a firecracker punk anthem in the form of TV Luv Song. Imagine if The Cribs had been brought up on The Dead Kennedys; coming in at under the two minute mark, the track is set to see a 7″ release later in the year.
