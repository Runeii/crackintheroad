Of the two songs, <em>Black Birds</em> is the one that excites me most, with it’s shoegaze leanings, whilst<em> Glass Body</em> squeezes more into the aforementioned dream-pop territory.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F108819172\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F108820944\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24181-introducing-soft-as-snow","category":"introducing","date":1378818687000,"wpid":24181,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":109,"src":"2013/09/1170827_558159857577164_2038452732_n-165x109.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUI/8QAIRAAAQMCBwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxESBAUHFCEiI1H/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AlaC5tgG7YSR2hpAPWtStTNmgtHkDx8REH//Z"},"createdAt":1587283004473,"updatedAt":1588443767159,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/09/1170827_558159857577164_2038452732_n-165x109.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
