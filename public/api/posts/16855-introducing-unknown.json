Sadly, with the trick having been played numerous times already with the likes of <strong>WU LYF</strong>,<strong> Faws</strong> and <strong>Stay +</strong>, if you were to pin your money on either, youâ€™d probably mark it down as a slightly pretentious move at gaining promotion. Ultimately, if/when it comes to performing live, the identity of the 21 year old producer will undoubtedly be unveiled.</p>\n<p>With an insightful ear for a beat and cautious yet confident approach to developing atmosphere, his tracks adopt and toy with the notions of dubstep and minimal house. Splicing vocal samples and heavy side-chain compression with a Midas touch, <strong>Unknown</strong> masters the essence of entrancing and wondrous soundscapes. Check out the new <em>#006</em> and my personal favourite <em>#003</em> below, and head to his/her Youtube channel for more.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7k95hkPZSN0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUIiqCC5bwA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16855-introducing-unknown","category":"introducing","date":1339248069000,"wpid":16855,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285120402,"updatedAt":1588441777068,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/a8ca1855ebcd08dc6203d67560c76a37110c9fc3.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
