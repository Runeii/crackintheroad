With the likes of Youth Lagoon and Washed Out carving out names for themselves, (albeit expanding to larger numbers on the live circuit), it’s an immensely exciting and unrestrained time to be a musician. Christopher Stewart exploits this to its core, under his moniker <strong>Dead Ceremony</strong>. New track<em> Trophy</em> is an expertly constructed lament; weepingly honest and blossoming into a force of fantastical beauty.
