Combining pop, rock and jazz influences, they create perfectly rounded energetic, bouncy tunes, which are easy on the ears as well as being joyfully uplifting. Having received rave reviews from <strong>Drowned In Sound</strong>, as well as <strong>Huw Stephens</strong> declaring himself a fan, <strong>Dog is Dead </strong>are certainly destined for bigger things. Their debut single “<em>Glockenspiel Song</em>” is released on itunes today, and is a mesmerising pop spectacular, part <strong>Guillemots</strong>, part <strong>Los Campesinos!</strong>, the song reaches it’s pinnacle with the guys shouting “<em>we are a mess! we failures! and we love it!</em>” over the top of a scintillatingly played saxophone. So if you have a spare 79p, there are few better ways you could spend it than on <strong>Dog Is Dead’s</strong> debut single.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/dogisdeadband\">Check Out Their Myspace</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/glockenspiel-song/id372218236\">Buy Glockenspiel Song on iTunes</a></p>\n","slug":"1257-review-dog-is-dead-glockenspiel-song","category":"music","date":1275945920000,"wpid":1257,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":3888,"height":2592,"src":"2010/06/img_1591.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIRAAAgECBgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABEEBRITITEUIlH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIRES/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDHBlmS7UcKYh10wsUmAdWZiQwdxyLAC2kfe6ieJh29laQKeRfulKtRwOtP/9k="},"createdAt":1587295211504,"updatedAt":1588403566884,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2010/06/img_1591.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
