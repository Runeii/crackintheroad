It’s a brave change to make – and runs the risk of being enveloped by unoriginality – but that is a fear that is quickly diminished – it’s a masterful track, and the presence of some brass sampling and fantastic vocal work adds some welcome colour to proceedings. The second half of the track, in particular, is as familiar as it is exciting.</p>\n<p><em>Quiet Confidence</em> is out in March. It’s probably going to be quite good.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F129285771&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26039-new-ninetails-radiant-hex","category":"music","date":1389715180000,"wpid":26039,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":960,"src":"2014/01/4dnqgsihqbs86hjqimrkfatzxt_qxa0x6ft66yt8r4i.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGB//EACMQAAIBAwMEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAFIQYREgQVMVFBcdL/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE/8QAGhEBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxESE//aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Azbp7XpuW2SSC+zKYhs0j26VV+AOIB38+6Ljv1vjRUGpmIUAA9mk/dKeKtomZmUFhDwBIyFDnYfQ9VOTYmcDADHFB8qWXoiDJYDTP/9k="},"createdAt":1587282559584,"updatedAt":1588403521589,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d16","old_image":"2014/01/4dnqgsihqbs86hjqimrkfatzxt_qxa0x6ft66yt8r4i.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
