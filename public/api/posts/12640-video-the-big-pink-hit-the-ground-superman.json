Nope, me neither.</p><p> Aside from that song about dominoes and girls, they never really lived up to the hype that certain magazines lavished upon them. Their debut album was criminally disappointing, and their own stage antics and uncompromising performances have earned them somewhat of a bad reputation. So, here they are trying to put the past couple of years behind them with new single and video <em>Hit The Ground (Superman)</em>. Filmed in what looks like their gran’s living room, and showing a couple lying in bed and people making funny facial expressions before all culminating in one big party, it’s distinctively average. Rather fitting for the track then.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9_xniHg8pc\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12640-video-the-big-pink-hit-the-ground-superman","category":"music","date":1321482874000,"wpid":12640,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293449811,"updatedAt":1588441786143,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/23abf79989bd0bf1028d9f18d341484e6bbead55.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
