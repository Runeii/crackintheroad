Several months since he last released any music, and LERK has returned with a new gem in the form of <em>PLACATE</em>, a dark, often uncompromising electronic number, that echos Burial in atmosphere, yet is more in line with Nosaj Thing in regards to composition. Check out <em>PLACATE</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F113111489\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24429-new-lerk-placate","category":"music","date":1380488984000,"wpid":24429,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282930354,"updatedAt":1588441761990,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/e969c7399ec4f8339d9742629e0492103ef7bf18.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
