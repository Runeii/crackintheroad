It’ll be difficult to find a single article on <strong>Tev’n</strong> that doesn’t reference SOHN and/or The Weeknd, yet there’s a more late 90’s / early 00’s feel to his R&B infused style, and, an unconventional comparison it may be, but there’s a certain element of a ‘cooler’ Craig David to Falling Away.
