Would they have received more online coverage if their name wasn’t so similar to one of 2014’s breakout stars, Haerts? Possibly, yet as a standalone track,<em> Lips</em> is more than worthy of a mention, even if it still falls a long way short of All These Things That I’ve Done.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178387500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30372-new-hearts-lips","category":"music","date":1418471570000,"wpid":30372,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":960,"src":"2014/12/10432128_324469044411992_269280476937493696_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwEF/8QAJRAAAQIFAwQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAMFERITMUEHFSHRIlST/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AFCodZqKwqTppOmFWioy8kpJJXb487XyBPHg8xmy+vFDTLQHEt/rAAL0m90Zc4nLyL7QwmnMVKJLNsSdyZSfUTtrH6Tb8k+oD//Z"},"createdAt":1587281782729,"updatedAt":1588403513432,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/12/10432128_324469044411992_269280476937493696_n.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
