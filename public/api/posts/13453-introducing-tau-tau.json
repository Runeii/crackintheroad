This debut EP from New York’s <strong>Tau Tau</strong> may well fit the ethereal, lo-fi stereotype that many chillwave artists are unfairly branded with, yet it’s the pop capabilities within the four tracks that really elevate it above the mundane.</p><p> The minimal, trance inspired beat on <em>Serum (Intro)</em> provokes comparisons to <strong>Blake</strong> or <strong>Jamie Woon</strong>, whilst keeping the production down to it’s bare bones.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1872727964/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>EP highlight <em>Preparing A Three Course Meal For A Buddhist Monk</em> is very much in a similar vein to the likes of <strong>Toro y Moi</strong> and<strong> Neon Indian</strong>; finding the vocals injected with plenty of reverb.

Comparisons can also be made to other bedroom producers (sonically that’s how it comes across), with the likes of <strong>Dimes Make Dollars</strong> and <strong>ORIG∆MI</strong> immediately coming to mind. With these four tracks, <strong>Tau Tau</strong> has ear-marked his/their music as a one to keep an ear out for in 2012, and I for one sincerely hope that they achieve their full potential.</p>\n<p>Download the full EP via bandcamp below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1853872060/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13453-introducing-tau-tau","category":"introducing","date":1325636169000,"wpid":13453,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2012/01/1758420766-1-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEG/8QAIxAAAQIGAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFERIhExUkMVJxkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAGhEBAAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACERIhUf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A19JrI4GnaoSll1RSOO4Vqx1+weu087VR5pROybK3BlHFuOSfItSsXFlORvb5FXNzOau4e8+5gmnFXspW1P/Z"},"createdAt":1587293163293,"updatedAt":1588443776722,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/01/1758420766-1-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
