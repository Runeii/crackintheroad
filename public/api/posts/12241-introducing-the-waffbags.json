If you’re not a fan of slightly cheesy, <strong>Scott Walker</strong> inspired 60’s ballads then <strong>The Waffbags</strong> are probably not for you. However, if like myself, you love charming sonnets and a sultry drawl that sounds as if it should belong in an American dinner, then you’re gonna lap this up.</p>\n<p>Picture this. A near desolate cinema, a 1960’s classic romantic film flickers despairingly on the screen, whilst in the second row from the back, a young lad with slicked back hair stretches his arm around his petite woman. There’s a ballroom scene, soundtracked by <em>After All Said And Done</em>; the audience gasp as the hopelessly in love couple pirouette gracefully, before collapsing into a magnificent wooden four poster bed.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2296878111/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>What More</em> is a stunning piano led love song; the girl in the second row from the back is tearing up, as the lead singer weeps <em>‘there’s something about her eyes, what more could I ask for?’</em>. This song is written for her. It has to be.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1991479766/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>As the credits roll and the lovestruck young couple leave, the ever so slightly more jovial <em>What A Shame</em> plays, completing their nigh on perfect evening.
