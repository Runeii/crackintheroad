Si.</strong> are, listing their names on <a href=\"https://mtsi.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp</a> as Sarah, Jesse (presumably from Kisses) and Mike, the trio hail from LA, and already appear to be grabbing the attention of other musicians (followers on Soundcloud include, <strong>RAC</strong> and <strong>Kisses</strong>). Their two debut tracks, True and Oh are two of the finest slices of ethereal pop I’ve heard in recent times, lead by a stunning vocal line, underpinned by a sea of gorgeous textures. Trust me on this, <strong>Mt. Si.</strong> are going far. Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156061048&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156061054&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29125-introducing-mt-si","category":"music","date":1405008076000,"wpid":29125,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282054792,"updatedAt":1588441756083,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ded9ef8d1d2cac888d86d3cf5e7eed5014b03a57.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
