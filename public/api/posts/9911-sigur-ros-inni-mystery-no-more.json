Whilst the trailer offered very little beyond the actual name of the project (and with attempts to contact the bands’ management resulting in a ‘wait and see’ response) it fell to <strong>Venice Days</strong>, a part of the <strong>Venice Film Festival</strong>, to announce that <em>Inní</em> will be a film and they will be the ones to premiere it.</p>\n<p>The film has been recorded by <strong>Vincent Morisset</strong>, famously known for being the individual behind the <em>Mirror Noir</em> live DVD for <strong>Arcade Fire’s</strong> second album. It is being listed as a ‘surprise film event’ and all indications are that it will be largely composed of footage shot during the band’s 2008 tour. How can we be sure of this? Because a number of clips attributed to <strong>Vincent Morisset</strong> have been viewable on Youtube for a few months now. Notably, the first shot of <em>Svefn-G-Englar</em> is identical to one featured in the <em>Inní</em> video, as well as the overall style of the two being similar.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Vencie Film Festival</strong> kicks off on the 31st August, so it won’t be long before more concrete information surfaces regarding the project.</p>\n<p>Watch the clips of <a title=\"Morisset's Sigur Rós work\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/theblahs\" target=\"_blank\">Morisset’s Sigur Rós work here</a>, and catch the <em>Inní</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><iframe id=\"tsFrame92680\" src=\"https://cdn.topspin.net/api/v2/widget/player/92680\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"9911-sigur-ros-inni-mystery-no-more","category":"music","date":1313245237000,"wpid":9911,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/sigur-ros-live-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUH/8QAJhAAAgECBQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABIEBQYRYRMhFSIjMVFSkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME/8QAGxEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEQMSMYH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMO1zgsN4lDBkRV8C49JQfMGPuG55+BQItIyvGjtmeXIWAJVpDuOD2qF1ZLZG6j3HuTcd6Pe32P7RFXqg1eSjIULFtez/9k="},"createdAt":1587294090435,"updatedAt":1588403550974,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2011/08/sigur-ros-live-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
