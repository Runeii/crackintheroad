In many ways it does what it says on the tin. One piano and some of the most graceful voices i’ve heard in a long time. The harmonies are reserved yet delicate, the piano melodies are simple yet heartfelt and in essence it just want to pull at your heart strings,  which my god it achieves.</p>\n<p><em>“I’ll come running if you love me today”</em> the girls plead on <strong><em>‘</em></strong><em>Save Me A Place</em>‘. It’s music that’s surrounded by devotion, yet has enough backbone to not only believe in, but also to inspire. It promotes the idea that true human devotion to another is both empowering and natural.</p>\n<p>Stream the whole album below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3988782361/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"150\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"11942-new-nona-marie-and-the-choir-ii","category":"music","date":1319180424000,"wpid":11942,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293671736,"updatedAt":1587825913247,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","categories":["music","new"]}
