The synths and bass are thicker; the vocals powerful, taking reference from <strong>Gabriel Bruce</strong>, and the overall pop aesthetic takes centre stage. Interested to see where this project goes again.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3994543538/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24450-new-apache-jackson-bored-cops","category":"music","date":1380568568000,"wpid":24450,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282926592,"updatedAt":1588441761937,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273b0c1d5732a0c0f670688beac.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
