There’s not much out there to give any indication of the content and style of the album, but if the 65 minute running time and 7-track listing is anything to go on, it’s likely to be one of her most experimental and exciting works to date.</p>\n<p>Track listing:</p>\n<p>Snowflake<br />\nLake Tahoe<br />\nMisty<br />\nWildman<br />\nSnowed In At Wheeler Street<br />\n50 Words For Snow<br />\nAmong Angels</p>\n","slug":"11071-new-kate-bush-album-announced","category":"music","date":1315825421000,"wpid":11071,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":618,"height":618,"src":"2011/09/618w_kate_bush_50_words_for_snow.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgUH/8QAIxAAAQMDAwUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEQYTIQcyQlFhcv/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALHT+LaX9MpW7slW3gAhPPHqs3uMSxJuEkJQwQHVAHP0/KKaLlSBYQA+7j9micuZJEt7Eh7vV5n3UpH/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293891654,"updatedAt":1588403548498,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d35","old_image":"2011/09/618w_kate_bush_50_words_for_snow.jpg","categories":["music","news"]}
