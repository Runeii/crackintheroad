'a word usually used at the end of a sentence to express agreement and/or excitement. similar to the word Amen.'\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/friendzone/02-chuch-produced-by\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Chuch</i></a>, for Main Attrakionz, and their stuttering, chiming backdrop for Deniro Farrar’s contrastingly gritty rhymes on <a title=\"We all hope we make it with those rhymes, man. \" href=\"https://denirofarrar.bandcamp.com/album/the-patriarch\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Back/Forth/Back</i></a>. Hunting around for further collected sustenance wasn’t easy, scattered as it was across a disparate series of mixtapes and EPs, so – and here’s the connect – news of a Friendzone full-length called <em><strong>DX</strong></em><strong> </strong>(which ‘dropped’, as I believe popular parlance has it, yesterday) came pretty sweet to me.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0pt none; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3179919466/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Delineating the hip-hop instrumental is often as hazy a business as the tones contained therein, but where artists in a vaguely similar ballpark – say, Clams Casino or Blue Sky Black Death – opt for a classy meld of the organic and synthesised, <b><i>DX</i></b> is unabashedly clad in digital dayglo, a glorious neon mess of anime electro-vomit, churned up from electronica and hip-hop over the last couple of decades.  It’s referential, if not reverential, of Aphex Twin (they’ve called a song <i>RETAILXTAL</i>, the cheeky scamps), could be said to filter Burial through Kanye (the former’s ubiquitous cut-up vox warped a la West’s autotuned chipmunk soul), and comes up something like if Baths’ <b><i>Cerulean </i></b>were a euphoric trap record. So, yeah, tough to pigeonhole, though far as I can tell <i>ALL MY LIFE+ </i>(and to a lesser extent, <i>ANOTHER JAM FOR THE AGES~!</i>) is basically a cover of <a title=\"Those chords are just some of the best things ever, aren't they?\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdQY7BusJNU\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Time After Time</i></a>, which is to my mind one of the greatest songs ever. So that should help.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0pt none; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3179919466/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=9/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Despite Friendzone’s obvious penchant for the pretty, their ultra-modern (even trashy) electronic medium means that <strong><em>DX</em></strong>‘s many moments of sparkling beauty always come off surprising. The limpid piano on <i>LUV YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING</i>, for example, which cascades glittering in and out of those sliced, bent, bodiless voices, or the following <i>8AM,</i> which sounds like a last dance for its titular time, slow swells mimicking the wistful horn lines of some forgotten Midwest emo troupe. As a consequence, Friendzone maintain across the length of <em><strong>DX</strong></em> the stoned, glowing gorgeousness that had me so enthralled by those first two cuts. And I’m pretty happy about it.</p>\n<p>Friendzone have put <b><i>DX </i></b>in its entirety up on <a title=\"Oh...ain't that...FRIENDLY\" href=\"https://friendzone.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>, for a name your price download.</p>\n","slug":"24542-new-friendzone-dx","category":"music","date":1381414635000,"wpid":24542,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":110,"src":"2013/10/friendzone-165x110.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHhAAAQQDAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBSEABBETMZH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDFoKV2ImJ3JCPQy8z4QxsNvNJKVFSr99NVwjhyYVKsFRKY9lKSaAvn3GMOElv/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282893735,"updatedAt":1588443766706,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2013/10/friendzone-165x110.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
