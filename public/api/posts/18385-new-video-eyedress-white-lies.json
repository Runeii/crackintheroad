Like the material that came before, it’s fairly different in style to his earlier work, with this cut taking a surprisingly interesting glitch/dub approach. Yet despite his sporadic attitude to creation, his music still manages to sound like <strong>Eyedress</strong>, which for a brand new artist is achievement in itself.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/53742536?badge=0&color=8179ed\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/53742536\">Eyedress – White Lies</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/awesomer\">EYEDRESS</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n","slug":"18385-new-video-eyedress-white-lies","category":"music","date":1353364736000,"wpid":18385,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284488038,"updatedAt":1588441773565,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/04a02560cc9f82cf7768fa373aa96d9a77517f8d.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
