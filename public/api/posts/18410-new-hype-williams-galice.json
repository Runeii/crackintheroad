The track is still crawling with ideas, textures and tones, with a narrative that still very much exists in the world of metaphysics, this time however it can at least be imagined.</p>\n<p><em>Galice</em>’ is taken from the pair’s forthcoming <em>London 2012 </em>tour CD, it will be available at tomorrow’s show. All tickets are on the door, which open at 9pm, get down early to avoid disappointment.</p>\n<p>via <a href=\"https://www.nofearofpop.net/blog/hype-williams-galice\">No Fear of Pop</a></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F68533184&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18410-new-hype-williams-galice","category":"music","date":1353680704000,"wpid":18410,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":630,"height":361,"src":"2012/11/hype-williams.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQRAAIDBQYicRIhMf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/8QAGREBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACERIh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCGvvhV5OMSjOK3iIGT6I5HskGs3a1NW9nNdLNvleTEAx77pShySXazmf/Z"},"createdAt":1587284469487,"updatedAt":1588403535311,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/11/hype-williams.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
