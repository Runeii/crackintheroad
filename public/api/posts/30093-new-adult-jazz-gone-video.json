Creating a monochromatic representation of the brilliant ‘Am Gone’, we follow the fate of a lone soul trapped in a stock working his way towards his freedom before reaching a rather unexpected conclusion. This video is as clever and surprising as Adult Jazz’s music, and for that reason we strongly advise you watch it.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/P2rPHqj-9ss\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"30093-new-adult-jazz-gone-video","category":"music","date":1413306813000,"wpid":30093,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281834548,"updatedAt":1588441753737,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/433eeb062596df3b0180deda5e8992e5c107a850.jpg","categories":["music","newnews","videos"]}
