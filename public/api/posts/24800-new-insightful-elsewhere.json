{"id":"5e9c0386774c2610387e4b47","artists":["5e9b69047a1236eccfeb2169"],"title":"New: Insightful – Elsewhere","content":"<p>Okay, so “new” might be pushing it slightly here – <em>Elsewhere</em>, the latest from <strong>Insightful</strong> (arguably one of the Soulection label’s finest artists), was released a over a week ago.</p><p> But let’s ignore that. Focus, instead, on this utterly sublime album. Matthew Suggett’s intertwining of hip-hop beats and psychedelic synths is pretty much flawless, and it’s as engaging as it is chilled – which is no easy combination to achieve.</p>\n<p>Guest vocals from singer-songwriter <strong>Kimberly Lola</strong> and <strong>Jessica Cooke</strong> stand out in particular (if you really must listen to only one track, make it the truly beautiful ‘She Swoons’), and inject a welcome amount of variety into the album. But <strong>Insightful</strong> shines on his own, too, as his top-notch production glues together the pieces that he brings together in his songwriting.</p>\n<p>It’s available now, on a pay-what-you-want basis. It’s certainly worth a few quid.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F12481007&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24800-new-insightful-elsewhere","category":"music","date":1382993504000,"wpid":24800,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282822519,"updatedAt":1588441761432,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d16","old_image":"generated/7180a77b5716d4f54996f0d7138a3fabb2641d64.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
