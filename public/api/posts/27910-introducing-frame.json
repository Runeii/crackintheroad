New cut, <em>Polarizer</em> feels hugely Blondie influenced, alongside the likes of The Pretenders and The B-52’s; two and a half minutes, straight to the point, yet endearingly glamorous pop. These two tracks alone indicate an electrifying live show.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142190412&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/133224593&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27910-introducing-frame","category":"introducing","date":1397399335000,"wpid":27910,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282222262,"updatedAt":1588441758678,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/efa0f43f254a84f3060d798b12e1d9ab3ca63ca8.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
