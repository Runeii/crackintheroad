Delaware based musician <strong>Luke Nigro</strong> aka <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Young-Knees/225223584229972?sk=info\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Young Knees</strong></a> has an appealing honesty in his songs that’s so rarely found, despite the slightly shoddy recording quality. With two tracks both clocking in at over six minutes, it’s an ambitious debut, made even more spectacular by opening the premier track <em>Sink</em> with a single, elegantly held note. Whilst on the B-side, <em>Function</em> is a minimalist, instrumental number, almost bluesy in parts and melancholic in tone.</p>\n<p>From these debut couple of tracks, it’s clear that <strong>Young Knees</strong> could perhaps do with slicker production, but there’s no doubting the songwriting ability and majestic air conjured up throughout. Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1928847949/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14390-introducing-young-knees","category":"introducing","date":1327426309000,"wpid":14390,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":221,"src":"2012/01/334683_225230927562571_225223584229972_464632_16812219_o-165x221.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587293004855,"updatedAt":1588443776230,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/01/334683_225230927562571_225223584229972_464632_16812219_o-165x221.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
