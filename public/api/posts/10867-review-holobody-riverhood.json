Released a couple of days ago, the nine tracks that form<strong><em> Riverhood</em></strong> are a fascinating blend of hip hop beats, folk inspired vocals and genuinely adorable songwriting.</p>\n<p><em>Riverbed</em> sees <strong>Charlotte</strong> taking lead vocal responsibilities, however whereas in some joint projects the vocalist can steal the show, this is certainly not the case with <strong>Holobody</strong>, as <strong>Green</strong> stamps his authority on the track with his magnificent compositions. As always, <strong>Sea Oleena’s</strong> tones are wonderfully soothing and nigh on perfect; stunningly aided by the ethereal instrumentation.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3524275469/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://holobody.bandcamp.com/track/hurricane-season\">Hurricane Season by Holobody</a></iframe></p>\n<p>The near vocal-less<em> Procession</em> finds <strong>Holobody</strong> combining menacingly dark dubstep influenced beats with swirling synths and harmonious samples. The folk-pop moments are unashamedly honest, such as opener <em>Unfold</em> and the funky, off beat <em>Michael</em>, however there are few artists who succeed in capturing the essence of idyllic songwriting in as magical a method as the<strong> Oleena</strong> siblings. It’s also rewarding to hear an artist try their hand at outright gospel music, as found on <strong>Holobody’s</strong> version of the infamous <em>Down To The River To Pray</em>, a song originally written by 19th Century American slaves. The track follows a traditional gospel pattern, vocal harmonies and repeated acoustic guitar riff, before breaking into a sea of reverb and white noise, proving fairly intoxicating.</p>\n<p>In a year when big money collaborations appear to be catch of the day, yet their outcomes have been somewhat questionable (see <strong>Blake & Vernon</strong>) and overwhelming forced (see <strong>Jay-Z & Kanye</strong>);<strong> Holobody</strong> have remained true to their family ties and it deservedly pays off. With <em><strong>Riverhood</strong></em>, <strong>Felix Green</strong> and <strong>Charlotte Oleena</strong> (real names <strong>Luke Loseth</strong> and <strong>Charlotte Loseth</strong>) have created a phenomenal piece of work, that appears to benefit from the numerous family bonds that feature throughout. The album notes pay credit to three other <strong>Loseth</strong> members, and it’s this true to life feel that allows the beauteous songwriting to breath, ensuring another fantastic release from <strong>Oleena</strong> and Co.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1381195483/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://holobody.bandcamp.com/track/riverbed\">Riverbed by Holobody</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10867-review-holobody-riverhood","category":"album-reviews","date":1315062146000,"wpid":10867,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":396,"src":"2011/09/299775_143918702362915_143917969029655_263322_4546104_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEE/8QAHxAAAQMFAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhESMSJS/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABP/EABkRAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMRMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AxYxl1niWs3KZNksMyFlMeI3I5SlfSVckE+fOgRr2rKyXCJMp59y2zQt1ZWoCUzoEnf6pSjXghMVNb6f/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293933833,"updatedAt":1588403549049,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/09/299775_143918702362915_143917969029655_263322_4546104_n.jpg","categories":["album-reviews","new","music"]}
