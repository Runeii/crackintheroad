Now signed to Dirty Hit (The 1975, Wolf Alice, The Japanese House & more), the duo are back with a brand new sound on the woozily psychedelic <em>Double Dutch</em>, that feels as much indebted to The Avalanches and Gorillaz as it does Tame Impala, yet ultimately sounds absolutely nothing like any of the aforementioned.
