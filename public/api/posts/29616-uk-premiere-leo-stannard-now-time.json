Managing to maintain a lyrical poignancy whilst still being a surefire radio hit is pretty difficult nowadays, but Stannard hits the nail right on the head, mixing the hooks of Ed Sheeran, with the composure of Ben Howard. Yet again proving his songwriting prowess, most notably his ability to penn a killer chorus which when combined with his stunning vocals show that he’s well and truly primed for the big time. Check out Now Is Not The Time below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/164834232%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-OZs7V&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/161655822&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29616-uk-premiere-leo-stannard-now-time","category":"music","date":1409217687000,"wpid":29616,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281953279,"updatedAt":1588441754509,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/bcf68175452729fc07b6a578c886491a77b89798.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
