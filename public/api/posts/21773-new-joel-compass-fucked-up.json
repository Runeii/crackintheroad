The work is still heavily autobiographical, yet now <strong>Compass</strong> takes on the role of the villain, venting the details of a sleeping girl in his bed to the backdrop of his girlfriend repeatedly calling him. It’s guilt smeared, regretful, honest as fuck and ultimately catchy as hell pop music, that’s arguably far more accomplished than his first effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Compass</strong>’ debut EP<i> Astronaut</i>, due to be released via Black Butter.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F91128544\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21773-new-joel-compass-fucked-up","category":"music","date":1368016938000,"wpid":21773,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1000,"height":668,"src":"2013/05/joel-compass.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQI/8QAHhAAAQQCAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABAxEEEgUhI1H/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AzTh8nNiSSDAMfpqLkQ29M99fFRJlxHIR6Vs7vVIiD//Z"},"createdAt":1587283522489,"updatedAt":1588403530135,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/05/joel-compass.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
