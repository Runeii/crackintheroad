New track, <em>Daddy</em>, takes a step back from the slick-pop of their previous outings, and almost serves as an interlude to what’s to come. Entirely instrumental, there’s hints of Irish duo <strong>Solar Bears</strong> in the production and grandeur of the track, check it out below and grab a free download under that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XY06-1zE2iA\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://emailunlock.com/weareiyes/daddy-demo/widget\" height=\"400\" width=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"21622-new-iyes-daddy","category":"mpfree","date":1367446355000,"wpid":21622,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":107,"src":"2013/05/13723_466742036720573_1129788997_n-165x107.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAED/8QAIBAAAgIBAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCEQAEEjEFFSJhgf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCNdJC5KYwsK1r3tHO0Q8bsWaNcH5maemtkmEu2aVlxB3l87l75xjA//9k="},"createdAt":1587283542504,"updatedAt":1588443768540,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/05/13723_466742036720573_1129788997_n-165x107.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
