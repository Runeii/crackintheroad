New single <em>The National Health</em> is all that, a three minute, riff heavy number, playing to <strong>Paul Smith’s</strong> witty lyrics alongside slightly disgruntled undertones. The title track from their forthcoming fourth record out 11 June, described by <strong>Smith</strong> with the following paragraph: <em>“We’re in a global recession and everyone is being bombarded with bouncy, happy music. The nation is out of control and the record is about taking back control, and being a force for change in your own life. It can’t speak for everybody but it has its eyes and ears all around us… that’s always been a Maximo Park thing: look at yourself.”</em> Excellent.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40706610&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15851-new-maximo-park-the-national-health","category":"music","date":1332936104000,"wpid":15851,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292612815,"updatedAt":1588441779614,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/maximo-park-165x109.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
