This new EP from 21 year old Sydney native <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/olivertankmusic\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Oliver Tank</strong></a> is a glorious masterpiece of ethereal ballads and intimate pop tracks. Whilst the title <em><strong>Dreams</strong></em> may possibly be the most overused word of 2011, there’s nothing mediocre about the release.</p>\n<p>Opening track <em>Up All Night</em> is a <strong>James Blake</strong>-esque masterpiece, yet succeeds where <strong>Blake’s</strong> debut LP failed, in creating something tangible and believable. <strong>Tank</strong> almost weeps<em> “will you teach me how to dance, real slow?”</em> with such emotion that Blake could only wish to inspire. The dubstep influenced beat on <em>Last Night I Heard Everything In Slow Motion</em> perfectly compliments <strong>Tank’s</strong> silky vocals, allowing the minimalism of the track to be exaggerated splendidly.
