{"id":"5e9bf9e68fb2d30d7769cd56","title":"Preview: Little Women, Big Stories","content":"<p>Tired of the same old processed dross at the movies? Would you like to see more women on screen, in proper roles? Check this out.</p><p> 2015 is the 30th anniversary of the Bechdel Test, the handy measure for female representation in film that originated in Allison Bechdel’s comic <em>Dykes To Watch Out For</em>. To commemorate the creation of this useful and telling measure <a title=\"The Bechdel Test Fest\" href=\"https://bechdeltestfest.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Bechdel Test Fest</a> are hosting a series of events throughout the year. For March the theme is <strong>Little Women, Big Stories</strong>; each of the four films has dynamic and inspiring young women at the centre. Furthermore each was written and directed by a woman, which is far too rare an occurrence. After every showing there will be a Q&A from a selection of very talented film folk, including actors, writers and journalists. Take your pick from the screenings below – or be a true film addict and go to all of them!
