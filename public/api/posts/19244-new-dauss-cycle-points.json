Drawing from the likes of <strong>Pantha Du Prince</strong> and <strong>Bonobo</strong>, <strong>Dauss</strong> may still be finding his feet, but <em>Cycle Points</em> is certainly worth clinging onto for the moment.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F75751876\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19244-new-dauss-cycle-points","category":"music","date":1358785077000,"wpid":19244,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284131258,"updatedAt":1587825880686,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","new","uncategorized"]}
