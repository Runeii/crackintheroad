They’ve already released material from the wondrously various likes of Juffage, ✝Hymns✝ and Shield Your Eyes this year, but far from resting on their laurels, they’re throwing more and more of the good stuff at us. Working up to the release of debut full-length <strong><em>Radial Images </em></strong>on Function, Brighton-based <strong>Love Among The Mannequins</strong> (featuring them out of <a title=\"Go To Smoking Lines\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/oyoubrokeneyes\">O You Broken Eyes</a>, <a title=\"Cooze and Scrot Rot\" href=\"https://shoesandsocksoff.tumblr.com/\">Shoes and Socks Off</a> and <a title=\"Look at pouting, look at me\" href=\"https://crookedmountaincrookedsea.bandcamp.com/\">Crooked Mountain Crooked Sea</a>) have created the archive footage-based video for <em>Alfred Garyevich Schnittke</em>, as well as putting the song up for download.</p>\n<p>As is probably par for the course for a band named after a line penned by J.G. Ballard, <em>Schnittke</em> manages to cram an impressive amount of references to the cultural greats of the last few centuries into its three and a quarter minutes. It can be snooty, silly, or ferociously forward-thinking, depending on which way you look at it, but whatever you decide, <em>Alfred Garyevich Schnittke </em>is a whole heckload of juddering, distorted, Pavement-flavoured fun. Can you think of another guitar band who can make the words ‘<em>Beethoven’s Burton’s line’ </em>sound so motherfuckin’ catchy? Nah. Didn’t think so.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lhMrX-qfwgg\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em><strong>Radial Images </strong></em>is out Monday 17th November on Function Records.
