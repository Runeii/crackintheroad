With<strong> Hudson Mohawke</strong> on production duties <em>JUMANJI</em> was always going to be ridiculously tight, however that’s not to say it’s necessarily any good.</p><p> I mean, compare her to the past greats of her genre, the likes of<strong> Lauryn Hill</strong>,<strong> Lil’ Kim</strong> and <strong>MC Lyte</strong> and well, it’s almost offensive to even consider <strong>Banks</strong> in the same sport, nevermind league. I guess she’s got good PR.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F46045706&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16477-new-azealia-banks-jumanji","category":"mpfree","date":1337005629000,"wpid":16477,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587288942472,"updatedAt":1588441778343,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/d08b993548a00a5a535e20c9c2aff7b6287dfb1e.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
