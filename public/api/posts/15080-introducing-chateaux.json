With the tag ‘Beach House’, the track does represent a certain vibe that does pertain to the pure fun and sun kissed optimism of time spent on the beach. Standing as the band’s first effort, after what seems like a period of more folk orientated creativity, it’ll be interesting to see how <strong>Flint </strong>& co built on this jaunty, lo-fi sound.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F34696252&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15080-introducing-chateaux","category":"introducing","date":1329401624000,"wpid":15080,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292815250,"updatedAt":1588441781418,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2012/02/chateaux-165x194.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
