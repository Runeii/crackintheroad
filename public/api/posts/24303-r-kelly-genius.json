Kelly – Genius","content":"<p>With all the talk surrounding Kanye West’s decision to refer to himself as a God and Gucci Mane’s rapid descent into insanity, it’s almost, although not quite, possible to forget about the master of urban misguided-ness (that’s not actually a word, but who’s gonna stop me? You?); R.</p><p> Kelly.</p>\n<p>It’s been a long and lonely time since the Prince of Pillowtalk dropped his last album, well, about a year, but, in my book, that’s too lengthy. ‘Genius’ is the latest track that the Sultan of Sensuality has dropped from his upcoming album, <em>Black Panties, </em>and it doesn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p>Did I hear anyone say smooth jam? ‘Genius’ has that. Want some “uhs” that sit halfway between sexy and stalker? The Viceroy of Voluptuousness has you covered. Weird metaphors about being a sex genius? All over that like butter on toast. If R. Kelly is butter and your girlfriend is toast.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F110122015\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24303-r-kelly-genius","category":"uncategorized","date":1379417073000,"wpid":24303,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282962978,"updatedAt":1588441762425,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/b81390065f0c65c26270a4ca1d2ceae3e30efed6.jpg","categories":["uncategorized"]}
