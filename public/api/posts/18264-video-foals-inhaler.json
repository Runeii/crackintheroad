{"id":"5e9c0a34774c2610387e51dc","artists":["5e9b68f87a1236eccfeb206d"],"title":"Video: Foals – Inhaler","content":"<p>After announcing a set of almost instantly sold out small gigs and a cryptic teaser on their website earlier this week,<strong> Foals</strong> have been somewhat elusive of late.</p><p> Their silence has been broken by the release of<em> Inhaler</em>, the new single from their upcoming third album <em><strong>Holy Fire</strong></em>. This single marks a complete departure from the math rock mystique that the band still flirted with on second album <em><strong>Total Life Forever</strong></em>. The new album title is a fitting tribute to a track which acts as a truer representation of <strong>Foals</strong> live sound. It’s a sharp contrast between light and shade. Fragmented guitars juxtaposed with a towering chorus reminiscent of <strong>Young Legionnaire</strong>.</p>\n<p>From this it’s possible to deduce only one thing; we should forget everything we knew about <strong>Foals</strong>. It’s easy for a band to repeat a successful formula; to spew out verbatim time and again. Fortunately there are those who see this as anathema. The band you knew is dead. <strong><em>Antidotes</em></strong> is dead.<strong><em> Total Life Forever</em></strong> is dead. Foals are dead, long live Foals.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJ_PMvjmC6M\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18264-video-foals-inhaler","category":"music","date":1352366422000,"wpid":18264,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284532956,"updatedAt":1588441773989,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d28","old_image":"generated/403a242ef6e450a7d4ffd8e2975ed77ad6a32146.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
