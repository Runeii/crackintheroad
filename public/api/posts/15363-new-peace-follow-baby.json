Anyway, it’s perfect for live shows, and serves to cement the group as one of 2012’s most exciting new acts.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F37967383&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15363-new-peace-follow-baby","category":"music","date":1330426227000,"wpid":15363,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292743367,"updatedAt":1588441780672,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/02/peace--950x632.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
