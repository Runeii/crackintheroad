{"id":"5e9c08b9774c2610387e5072","artists":["5e9b68f87a1236eccfeb20cc"],"title":"Introducing: Gleemer","content":"<p>New York’s<strong> Gleemer</strong> aka <strong>Corey Coffman</strong> has an element of Good Will Hunting about him.</p><p> Working at Atlantic Sound Studios in Brooklyn, Goffman recorded his debut release <strong><em>Death Sky, Soft Eye</em></strong> in the off-hours between work, I have this perception of<strong> Gleemer</strong> recording in the early hours of the morning, unintentionally leaving snippets of his music on the computers, hence the GWH comparison. Sadly, I have a feeling it’s maybe not quite that picturesque, still, for a debut release, it’s one of the strongest you’ll hear this year.</p>\n<p>Ranging from the shoegaze drawl of<em> Breezy</em> to the melancholic, Youth Lagoon-esque tinkle of <em>Honeybear</em>, it’s emotionally raw, whilst at times verging upon epic. Experimenting with a varied palette of sounds, <strong>Gleemer</strong> tries the upbeat (<em>Killing Machine</em>) and the more refined (<em>Bones</em>), succeeding each time in creating something wonderfully engaging. Personal highlight <em>Honeybear</em> is a moving tribute to a lost lover, touching and beautifully bleak. The vocals are imperfect yet alluring, the production is spot-on, and the songwriting excels throughout; what else do you want? Check out Honeybear and Killing Machine below, and if that does it for you, then grab the full album below that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73873890\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73876784\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe><br />\n<iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2688177295/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19179-introducing-gleemer","category":"introducing","date":1358446895000,"wpid":19179,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2013/01/185667_120889211413759_626767566_n-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQIH/8QAHRABAAEEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwUhERIxof/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEE/8QAGhEBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgARAQMEUf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A2/BYq3bjGOlY8geUk4ya+fKoeuVtRjo4dFJvrVr3q79guc4Jqf/Z"},"createdAt":1587284153594,"updatedAt":1588443770371,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/01/185667_120889211413759_626767566_n-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
