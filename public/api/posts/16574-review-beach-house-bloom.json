Or something like that.</p>\n<p>Horribly composed metaphors aside, Baltimore duo <strong>Beach House</strong> are indeed at the forefront of digitally driven culture, with their 2010 album <em><strong>Teen Dream</strong></em> cementing them as one of the finest outfits to emerge from the 00’s. Characterised by their elegant, majestic charm and commendable simplicity, their fourth album<em><strong> Bloom</strong></em> seeks to truly establish the dream pop group as a force to be reckoned with amongst mainstream indie artists.</p>\n<p>Now at the risk of sounding condescending, the beauty of<strong> Beach House’s</strong> previous three LPs has relied almost solely in the vulnerability, the unfaltering quality of songwriting and above all, the organic merging of <strong>Victoria Legrand’s</strong> vocals and <strong>Alex Scally’s</strong> decisive guitar sections. Sadly, these three vital aspects are found in short supply on <em><strong>Bloom</strong></em>, with the duo opting for more rigid, electronic foundations, most notably in the percussion sections, that could easily pass as presets from a 90’s Casio keyboard.</p>\n<p>Opener<em> Myth</em> is promising in so far as the eloquence and dazzling artistry of the track, yet you can’t help feeling that <strong>Beach House</strong> have done it before, but better. Lyrically there’s not much to call home about (<em>“Out in the endless green / Your eyes are so misleading / That’s when the car pulls up / It’s hood is black and gleaming”</em> – <em>Wild</em>) however all could be forgiven, if not for the inelastic feel of the record, rarely deviating from what was once a winning formula, yet the austere production leaves it floundering.</p>\n<p>There are signs of life amongst the likes of the shimmering<em> Other People</em> and album standout track<em> The Hours</em>, although ultimately proving little more than a brief shard of light in an otherwise one dimensional, intransigent tunnel. The 60’s pop and <strong>Big Star</strong> influences on <em><strong>Bloom</strong></em> are resoundingly prominent yet you can’t help but feel that they take themselves as their main inspiration, hence it being no surprise when they come across as a watered down, less emotionally attached version of their previous glories.</p>\n<p><em>New Year</em> trundles along nonchalantly without kicking into gear, before eventually shuffling out amongst a sea of hastily reverbed guitar lines and repeated vocal sections. In truth, the highlights of the record are still very much the same as with previous releases, but to a far lesser extent, and the immaculate production that tied together <em><strong>Teen Dream</strong></em> and <em><strong>Devotion</strong></em> off so perfectly, feels rather lackluster and halfhearted. Despite all I’ve said, I anticipate<strong><em> Bloom</em></strong> to achieve commercial success in spreading their music to more ears, however I can’t help feeling that this LP is “<strong>Beach House</strong> for the casual listener.”</p>\n<p>Check out <em>Myth</em> below, purchase the album <a href=\"https://www.beachhousebaltimore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/crackintheroad\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook page</a> to cast your opinion on <em><strong>Bloom</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuvWc3ToDHg\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16574-review-beach-house-bloom","category":"album-reviews","date":1337464953000,"wpid":16574,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587288011195,"updatedAt":1588441777906,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/b34aff7ff25bb5882346fee11f05a46f38fbfbd3.jpg","categories":["album-reviews","music"]}
