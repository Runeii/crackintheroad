After releasing their first single Excavate in 2011, the band were named one of Philly radio station WXPN’s “favorite new local acts” yet with only a few hundred likes on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Breakitupband\">Facebook</a> they seem to be largely overlooked by the wider world.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3171365404/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=11/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The band released their debut album in June 2013 and it’s a catchy little motherfucker filled with rough-around-the-edges emotion and neat pop hooks. I hear Explosions In The Sky in some of the drumming and guitar progressions and Sleater-Kinney in the vocals, so if either of them are your bag it’s worth streaming the album above or checking it out over on <a href=\"https://breakitup.bandcamp.com/\">Bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<p>Break It Up is drummer Casey Bell and guitarists and vocalists Jen Sperling and Dan Morse. You can find them on Facebook over <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Breakitupband\">here</a>.</p>\n","slug":"24318-introducing-break","category":"introducing","date":1379689728000,"wpid":24318,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282958673,"updatedAt":1588441762343,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d40","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273d10ab005472420ec014d4f4e.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
