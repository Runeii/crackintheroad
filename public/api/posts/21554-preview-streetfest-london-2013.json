The barsmith has been putting out consistently excellent music for a couple of years and it’ll be interesting to see how his music works in a live setting.</p>\n<p>Aside from the American rapper, there are a number of British MCs on the line-up, with Dot Rotten being the most prominent. You can also catch performances from the likes of DJ Vadim & DJ Nikki Beatnik, Livin Proof and Supa Dupa Fly.</p>\n<p>You can find further information about Streetfest and buy tickets <a href=\"https://www.streetfest.net/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n","slug":"21554-preview-streetfest-london-2013","category":"music","date":1367427944000,"wpid":21554,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283546014,"updatedAt":1587825872642,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","categories":["music","news"]}
