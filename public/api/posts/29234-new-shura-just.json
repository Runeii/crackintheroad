At this point it feels like her career could go two ways, either keep writing exquisite, cult-forming (seriously, look at people practically hyperventilating on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=shura&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>) pop songs, or crossover to a far more mainstream perspective. Either way, more songs like this please.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/159641999&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29234-new-shura-just","category":"music","date":1406103780000,"wpid":29234,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282035705,"updatedAt":1588441755840,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/98f86671be7250fee2afde4eb16dc8a990fdbe50.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
