This project explores the contact between the  body and an unknown space. Fiona works by hiring out quaint Hotel rooms, often flowery with polyester curtains, and pulling strange shapes in corners and across the furniture. She usually photographs herself because she feels it is easier to get the effect she is going for. Fiona’s style is delicate, sensitive and quiet. She channels femininity and the surreal, through her whole portfolio.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2014/01/guest3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25882\" alt=\"guest3\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest3.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest3.jpg 1000w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest3-50x38.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25883\" alt=\"guest2\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest2.jpg\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest2.jpg 533w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest2-33x50.jpg 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25884\" alt=\"guest1\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest1.jpg\" width=\"786\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest1.jpg 786w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/01/guest1-50x33.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Fiona explains:</p>\n<p>The concept begun in New York where I lived and worked for a summer. I simply wanted to document myself in the space that I called ‘home’ for that period of time. I looked for unique and interesting ways to submerge myself into my new surroundings. I started to stay in unknown spaces for shorter periods of time for a maximum of two days and then would move onto another space. These ‘spaces’ included hotels, hostels, b&b’s etc…</p>\n<p>‘Guest’ explores the relationship between person and an unfamiliar interior surrounding, whilst referencing how quickly the body adjusts to an unknown space and identifies with it. She often looks ballerina-esque in her movements because she references at a lot of expressionist and contemporary dance, especially the work of Pina Bausch, although she is not a dancer herself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fionaosborne.com\">https://www.fionaosborne.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cocknbullgallery.com/?p=969\">https://www.cocknbullgallery.com/?p=969</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cargocollective.com/stitchlondon\">https://cargocollective.com/stitchlondon</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"25862-artist-profile-fiona-osborne","category":"arts","date":1389254434000,"wpid":25862,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":909,"height":1280,"src":"2014/01/img_4629.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAOAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgUH/8QAIhAAAgEDBAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCABEhBAUGBxITMUGh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAX/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBhuTdr5Jx3aS0MQuMWpggfEliZBJIObEZAucjBrMn9eT97PU9YX5HxErXAvi+aTcWbFnW+llMGyNa5ePuMhEkfpqUzkMEskpunM2QJjKQla5GCamMWLGZdWb//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282593280,"updatedAt":1588403522278,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d2e","old_image":"2014/01/img_4629.jpg","categories":["arts"]}
