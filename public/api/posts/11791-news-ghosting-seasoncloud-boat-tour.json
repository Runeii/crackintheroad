{"id":"5e9c2e049b6559241525d78d","title":"News: Ghosting Season/Cloud Boat Tour","content":"<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">This week sees the beginning of <strong>Ghosting Season</strong>‘s mini tour with <strong>Cloud Boat</strong>, with events commencing at Manchester’s <strong>Kraak Gallery</strong> and yours truly will be representing <strong>Crack In The Road </strong>on the decks.</p><p> However this is no mere stroking of my ego, rather this tour, which includes further stops in London, Nottingham and Sheffield, is a fantastic opportunity to catch these two sets of highly talented pairs before they reach the widespread critical acclaim they are already developing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Manchester Event Details can be found <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=241284579255198&ref=ts\"><span style=\"color: #888888;\">here!</span></a></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>Ghosting Season</strong>, born out of the ashes of <strong>worriedaboutsatan</strong>, recently performed to a pack out audience supporting our favourite crazy kids <strong>TEETH</strong>, and since their move to their new home in Manchester the band have received only high praise from respected establishments such as <strong>Drowned in Sound </strong>and <strong>The Quietus</strong>. <strong>Crack In The Road </strong>managed to catch the band performing at Sheffield’s <strong>Tramlines Festival </strong>and we were thoroughly absorbed by the sheer brooding energy that builds in <strong>Ghosting Season</strong>‘s dark electronica sound. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>Cloud Boat </strong>are more than worthy support, with their beautiful orchestration of distorted vocals and calming beats earning their track ‘Lions on the Beach’ the coveted <strong>Clash Music</strong> Single of the Week. Recently signed to <strong>R&S Records</strong>, <strong>Cloud Boat </strong>are set to return to Manchester in November to perform at the famed <strong>Warehouse Project</strong>, however the intimate settings of <strong>Kraak Gallery </strong>will provide a very special performance indeed. Joining them on their Manchester leg is <strong>Crack In The Road </strong>favourite<strong> Hourglass Sea</strong>, and you can hear his brand new (and very rad) tune here!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25664328&\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25664328&\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hourglasssea/dream-warrior\"><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Dream Warrior</span></a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hourglasssea\"><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Hourglass Sea</span></a></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"11791-news-ghosting-seasoncloud-boat-tour","category":"music","date":1318940888000,"wpid":11791,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293700898,"updatedAt":1587825913662,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","categories":["music","news"]}
