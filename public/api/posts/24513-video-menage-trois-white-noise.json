As with the previously featured videos by Hozier and Sunboy, <em>White Noise</em> is a visual delight, and a real immersive experience that requires repeat viewing to truly digest. Shot in New York earlier in the year, there’s themes of jealously and adulation within this almost mythically conjured up world, all underpinned by one of the finest dance tracks of recent times. Comparison wise it’ll be almost impossible to avoid the Daft Punk references, yet it’s far from simply being a replica, and offers something mightily worthwhile in it’s own right. Check out the video below (make sure you watch it in HD).</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Q3xGiKWV8Go\" height=\"315\" width=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24513-video-menage-trois-white-noise","category":"music","date":1381079432000,"wpid":24513,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282905324,"updatedAt":1588441761778,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/10/screen-shot-2013-10-06-at-19.08.43-165x92.png","categories":["music","videos"]}
