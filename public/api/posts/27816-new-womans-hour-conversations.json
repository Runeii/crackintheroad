Featuring a few previously heard tracks, most notably <em>Her Ghost</em> and a beautifully reworked version of <em>Darkest Place</em>, alongside the newly streaming title track, it’s set to be one of the most anticipated records of the year. More upbeat than other outings, it’s bold, cinematic and further indication that Woman’s Hour are all set for a fantastic year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142342151&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27816-new-womans-hour-conversations","category":"music","date":1396999202000,"wpid":27816,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282247580,"updatedAt":1588441759059,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/b6f8041814623b24740177955a84afc189382c6b.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
