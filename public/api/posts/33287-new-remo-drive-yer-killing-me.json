Everything about the song is fun and accessible but keeps enough style and edge to make it stand out. The band have also somehow managed to avoid the over-nostalgic trap, while clearly not hiding their sonic influences of the late 00’s.  Keep an ear out for their debut album “Greatest Hits” dropping March 16th.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kaMiIaT-sg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33287-new-remo-drive-yer-killing-me","category":"music","date":1486742763000,"wpid":33287,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1620,"height":1080,"src":"2017/02/remosmall1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAfEAACAgIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAEAxEGBQcSIVH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAETFBUf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AkOMVEyctr9fWyqvRfwRHQlWGjs6+gNLXJ3IQuxNgAkn0FyDURFgEVWG4ZNcn/9k="},"createdAt":1587279923924,"updatedAt":1588403502728,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"2017/02/remosmall1.jpg","categories":["music"]}
