Their debut EP <em><strong>The Agony Of Lhermitte</strong></em> is fifteen minutes of frantic, guitar based indie-pop, coming across as hugely <strong>Pavement</strong> inspired; and boy is it enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Opener <em>Blackout</em> is enough to double anyone’s pulse, 126 seconds of ball busting alternative-rock and a fantastic introduction. Elsewhere, <em>Jacquie</em> is likely to be more appealing to NME crowd, but unlike <strong>The Vaccines</strong>, they don’t make you want to tear your ears off. To put it bluntly,<strong> Secret Connection</strong> have a genuine talent for writing insanely catchy, no strings attached, upbeat indie-pop tracks, and hey, I’m always going to have time for that.</p>\n<p>Secret Connection’s debut EP <em><strong>The Agony Of Lhermitte </strong></em>is out now and available to download for free from their <a href=\"https://secretconnection.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> page.
