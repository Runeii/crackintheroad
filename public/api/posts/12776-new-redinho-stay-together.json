His first two EP’s for the label, <em>Bare Blips</em> and <em>Edge Off</em>, were two of the best from the entire label, in my opinion. He can make the most mindfucking noises that sound out of this world. What I also love is the odd track has great <strong>D<em>â</em>m-Funk</strong>-esque vocoded vocals – as is apparent in this one. He’s playing <strong>Boiler Room</strong> once again tonight, as part of the <strong>Numbers</strong> showcase, alongside <strong>Randomer</strong>, <strong>Mosca</strong>, <strong>Deadboy</strong> and hosts <strong>Jackmaster</strong> & <strong>Spencer</strong> (tune in at 8pm).</p>\n<p>This single’s out at the beginning of December, and it really does hit the right spots – as with the addictiveness of <strong>Rustie</strong>‘s recent release, <strong>Redinho</strong>‘s track sours to greater heights at every break. The electronic voraciousness escalates and disappears into glee. I hate to type that last word but this guy really does make brilliant, and <em>fun</em>, electronic funk. One truly worthy for Christmas number one.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Stay Together below. The single is out December 5th via Numbers, and will be part of his debut album, out ‘sometime 2012’.</em></p>\n<p><center><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28569547&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28569547&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></center></p>\n","slug":"12776-new-redinho-stay-together","category":"music","date":1321982021000,"wpid":12776,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":188,"src":"2011/11/redinho-165x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAMAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUI/8QAIBAAAgEEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRMQUhIlFhcf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAER/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDOnGWUMlk5lCtM6OUBBwoA2SPfQVEOzTrG4lhKLE5UEYOPGdUZh3H7TFWv/9k="},"createdAt":1587293409960,"updatedAt":1588443777337,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/11/redinho-165x188.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
