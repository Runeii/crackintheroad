Less synthetic than their previous efforts, the track is hauntingly beautiful, its organic backbone topped off with pained vocals that conjure lost love and desperation. The track also comes with the announcement of their new E.P penned for September 29th. It’s a long wait, but I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be worth it.
