Berninger and co. have been teasing us for eighteen months with live performances of new material, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSEPs3r1yMk\">few</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3pM07vabBQ\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRA3lyMLjeg\">which</a> have ended up on the internet for eager fans to pore over and analyse . But as of this morning, we finally have something from the studio to get our teeth into – just after 11am on BBC6 Music, Lauren Laverne premiered <em>Demons, </em>second on the new album’s track-list.</p>\n<p>On first listen, one thing that jumps out is a slight change in tone from previous outing <strong><em>High Violet,</em></strong><em> </em>at least in the verses – musically it’s a bit looser and airier, compared to the tightly wound emotional intensity of much of that last album. But, after all, it’s still <strong>The National – </strong>the lyrics are all confused and worried introspection, grappling in a thousand ways with the nagging feeling that, for everything you may be doing, you’re not doing things quite right. There’s no other band that does it better.</p>\n<p>Listen to the track below, and head back over to BBC6 Music from 4pm today to catch the band in session with Steve Lamacq.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Hear the band’s BBC session <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p017fh37\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N527oBKIPMc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20837-new-the-national-demons","category":"music","date":1365419806000,"wpid":20837,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283653145,"updatedAt":1588441767259,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d1a","old_image":"generated/21b165584e04249611a0f8091f2dfcebdbf3d958.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
