Returning with a new record titled I Just Woke Up, Brother Dan is sure to find himself on musical radars across the blogging world with the two lead singles lifted from the release, the Beach Boys balladry cry of<em> For You</em> and the funky, 70’s riff heavy swagger of <em>Junk</em>. Two tellingly different tracks, that show altering sides to Brother Dan and display just a drop of the diversity that Kerr possesses. If <strong>Brother Dan</strong> was a Captured Tracks artist, then Pitchfork would be squirming deliriously at this moment in time. Check out both below, and keep your eyes locked on his <a href=\"https://brotherdan.bandcamp.com/album/i-just-woke-up\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp</a> page for when the full album drops.
