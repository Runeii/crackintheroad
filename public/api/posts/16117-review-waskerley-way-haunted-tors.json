Without intending to offend the acts who preceded<strong> Waskerley Way</strong>, they were noticeably more testosterone driven, and I’m sure they would agree, more brit-pop influenced than the glo-gaze vibe of <strong>Waskerley</strong>, especially when armed with a clarinet. Yet what made this performance so special, was that it worked, and left sizable portions of the crowd completely awestruck.</p>\n<p>As a musician, <strong>Michael Bridgewater</strong> is somewhat of an outsider amongst the tightly packed Newcastle scene. That’s not to say he’s an unmentionable outcast, but his ability to gather inspirations from further afield has allowed him to craft his own unique sound. New release <em><strong>Haunted Tors</strong></em> is a glistening shoegaze affair, and certainly his strongest outing to date, bringing together all the various concepts he’s played with since the inception of <strong>Waskerley Way.</strong></p>\n<p>The latter half of the album opener showcases <strong>Bridgewater</strong> at his utmost invigorating, diving mercilessly into a thoroughly immersing guitar riff and reverb drenched vocals. At times <strong>Waskerley’s</strong> vocals are vaguely reminiscent of a young <strong>Jarvis Cocker</strong>, with their unflappable subtly and ever-so-charming undertones; almost like the kind of guy you’d be more than happy to introduce your mum to.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F43209462&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe><br />\nPersonal highlight is the 80’s throwback of <em>Thinges To Come</em>, a no-frills attached glo-fi number, demonstrating just how far this young artist has come in a relatively short space of time. As I so often find, it’s all too easy to ignore what’s on your doorstep, however in the case of <strong>Waskerley Way</strong>, he’s well and truly found a place in my heart.</p>\n<p>Haunter Tors is out now via <a href=\"https://waskerleyway.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Waskerley Way’s bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F43209472&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16117-review-waskerley-way-haunted-tors","category":"album-reviews","date":1334932981000,"wpid":16117,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292535711,"updatedAt":1587825897792,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["album-reviews","mpfree","music"]}
