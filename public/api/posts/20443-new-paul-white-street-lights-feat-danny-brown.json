Danny Brown","content":"<p>With the release of <em>Old </em>rapidly approaching, Danny Brown has upped-the-ante in guest appearances over the last few weeks.</p><p> His latest track is a collaboration with the UK-based producer Paul White, who contributed three beats to Brown’s excellent <em>XXX.</em></p>\n<p>Although Brown has toned down his rapping recently, ‘Street Lights’ finds the MC breaking out a flow that would not be out of place on his last album. The Paul White beat displays dizzy drums that could easily pose a challenge to a less accomplished barsmith, but Danny Brown excels over it. He raps about social issues and the difficulties of living in a violent city, which, if Brown hadn’t already mentioned his change in lyrical direction, would come as a surprise. Luckily though, he sounds as hungry and vital as ever.</p>\n<p>‘Street Lights’ is being released as a single on the 15th April and you can give the track a spin below.<br />\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F83771585\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20443-new-paul-white-street-lights-feat-danny-brown","category":"music","date":1363787678000,"wpid":20443,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283757943,"updatedAt":1588441768287,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/5a9b9840b9fd0b75d862a0b0a3c0af787901d4ab.jpg","categories":["music","news","new","newnews"]}
