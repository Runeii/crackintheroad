Nauman- chained to the square- slowly, painfully, steps one foot in front of the other, exaggerating his movements and accentuating his body in a ludicrously strained manner. He moves back and forth continuously around the square, with the video on loop.</p>\n<p>The video was part of the so-remembered ‘great dawn of conceptualism’ in the late 60’s, and the dematerialization of the art object. Despite its progressiveness, performance art was still a very male dominated scene. Not to say there were no women making art; they just weren’t given the superstardom of such players as Nauman.</p>\n<p>This is where Liv’s piece is so brilliant, it comes at the work with a feminist critique, not of the content but of the male dominated studio ideal. In CRAWLING IN AN EXAGGERATED MANNER AROUND THE PERIMETER OF A SQUARE the audience looks down on a pink bikini clad, blonde wigged, heeled woman, as she laboriously crawls back and forth around the matching fluorescent pink square. At the same time though, she manipulates the audience- winking and licking her lips and blowing kisses, so she is the one in control.</p>\n<p>Nauman’s point of view is still celebrated, the awareness of the body as a medium, and the repetition of a pointless action – but here it is made new by fetishizing the artist/studio relationship. And the wig and heels.</p>\n<p>See more of Liv’s work <a href=\"https://livfontaine.tumblr.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n","slug":"22875-artist-profile-live-fontaine","category":"arts","date":1372943342000,"wpid":22875,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283320864,"updatedAt":1587825869197,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d43","categories":["arts"]}
