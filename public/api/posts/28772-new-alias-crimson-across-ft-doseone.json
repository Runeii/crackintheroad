Doseone","content":"<p>Alias has dropped a track from his upcoming album <em style=\"color: #4c4d51;\">Pitch Black Prism</em> featuring some bizzare bars from Anticon compatriot, Doesone.</p><p></p>\n<div style=\"color: #58595b;\">One of only two tracks on the LP with guest vocals, <em>Crimson Across It</em> is a dark glitchbeat banger punctuated by bass. It’s great to hear a track from two of Anticon’s founding fathers with such a fresh sound. Deep bass booms with Doseone’s rhymes about capitalist trash can only be a nod to the swathes of shit-hop out there. Mocking the mainstream (whatever that means anymore) and once again turning the whole rap game on its head.</div>\n<div style=\"color: #58595b;\"></div>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/153779259&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"color: #58595b;\">This isn’t the first time that Alias and Doseone have collaborated by far. The hip hop duo joined forces as part of Deep Puddle Dynamics and have collaborated on a number of other tracks with rappers and musicians across the Anticon label and beyond.</div>\n<div style=\"color: #58595b;\"></div>\n<div style=\"color: #58595b;\"><em>Alias’ Pitch Black Prism LP is</em> due on Anticon <span style=\"color: #4c4d51;\">June 24th </span>“It’s the first album that I’ve ever done using all software,” Alias says. “I used a Native Instruments Machine instead of MPC because I was bored and wanted to switch it up and keep it interesting. At first, I felt like I had fucked up because I didn’t know what I was doing and had to learn an entirely new process—but that was what made it fun.”</div>\n","slug":"28772-new-alias-crimson-across-ft-doseone","category":"music","date":1402519639000,"wpid":28772,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282092756,"updatedAt":1588441756643,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d40","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2735f76aacd29943edd1d7d5cb0.jpg","categories":["music","stream","new"]}
