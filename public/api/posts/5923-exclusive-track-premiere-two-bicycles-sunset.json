With pre-orders for the album going up tomorrow at Crash Symbol’s <a href=\"https://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/album/the-ocean\">bandcamp</a>, it’s one of their most highly anticipated releases to date. Sunset, available to listen to and download below is the second track on The Ocean, a moving narrative recounting a night spent at sea, a piece of music that has to be experienced to be truly understood.</p>\n<p>Here is what Jamison had to say about The Ocean:</p>\n<div>“The new Two Bicycles record is one of the most personal records  I’ve made to date. Even though there aren’t any vocals on the record, I  feel that I’ve expressed myself more clearly than I have on any other  release I’ve done. Although this is a “side project”, I take these songs  as seriously as I do the songs for the Teen Daze project.</div>\n<div>The record tells the story of a night spent at sea.  The beauty and hope that comes with the watching of the sun set,  swimming in the moonlight and looking back at life back on land in  fondness and happiness. But as the night falls, and the endless ocean  reveals itself as the chaotic, exilic wilderness, the main character  begins to feel isolated and on edge. The ocean can bring both optimism  and fear, hope and loneliness.</div>\n<div>The album was recorded in my bedroom, at the base of Mt. Cheam in Chilliwack, BC, from November 2010 to January 2011.”</div>\n<div><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/03/02-Sunset.mp3\">Two Bicycles – Sunset</a> (Left click stream, right click- save as download)</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/album/the-ocean\">Pre-order The Ocean here from tomorrow.</a></p>\n","slug":"5923-exclusive-track-premiere-two-bicycles-sunset","category":"music","date":1301335229000,"wpid":5923,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":950,"src":"2011/03/two-bicycles-the-ocean-1000x1000.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUH/8QAIxAAAgICAQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAhEQUSBhQxMkFxkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEREiH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM3o1o607vSaUVWCyBYW7ufUkA/HB1wfzHGxdcllTqaq2wCxPA++3eM8DKJOnXlkAZfMLo7HtypJasLIwWeUAEgAOcnvDE3h/9k="},"createdAt":1587294580458,"updatedAt":1588403558227,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/03/two-bicycles-the-ocean-1000x1000.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
