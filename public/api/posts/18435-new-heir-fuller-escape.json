A simple piano riff and choir-esque harmonies open the <em>Escape</em>, a track that’s six minutes of subtle yearning, characterised by the strained vocals and ethereal atmosphere, before exploding into life, practically collapsing in on itself under the seas of shoegaze inspired guitars. Illuminating the inner turmoil experienced during the breaking down of a relationship, <em>Escape</em> is stunning and devastating in equal parts.
