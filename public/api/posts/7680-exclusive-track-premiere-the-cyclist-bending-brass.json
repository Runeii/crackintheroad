Technicolor! debuted a couple of months back summarises the exceptional talent this eighteen year old Northern Irish musician has, incorporating dubstep and dance influences to create a unique and enjoyable sound. His music is the product of a £20 keyboard, which brings up random errors and technical faults, causing his vibrant, trance-inducing tracks. With his debut full length release, Bending Brass, out on <a href=\"https://crashsymbols.tumblr.com/\">Crash Symbols</a> later this month, we’re delighted to be able to exclusively premiere the title track from the record. Bending Brass is a more atmospheric, chilled out affair than previous tracks from The Cyclist, envisioning a lucid landscape, with it’s steady monotone-esque beat and it’s hazy keyboard effects. Both Bending Brass (available to download for free below) and Technicolor! serve as a welcome introduction to this young artist; make sure to check out and pre-order his full length release over at the links below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/05/04-Bending-Brass.mp3\">The Cyclist – Bending Brass</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/album/bending-brass\">Pre-order Bending Brass</a></p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11918126\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11918126\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/the-cyclist/technilama\">Technilama</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/the-cyclist\">The Cyclist</a></span> </p>\n<p>Now you can let us know what you think, or ‘like’ the article to share it with your friends!</p>\n","slug":"7680-exclusive-track-premiere-the-cyclist-bending-brass","category":"music","date":1305051707000,"wpid":7680,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294392425,"updatedAt":1588441789156,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/05/the-cyclist-bending-brass-188x188.jpg","categories":["music"]}
