Fusing early 00’s dubstep influences with the modern R&B sound pioneered by the likes of <strong>How To Dress Well</strong>, it’s diverse and utterly beautiful. Whilst I perhaps jumped the gun by predicting that 2012 would be the year of <strong>Noble Oak</strong>, his material has certainly been deserving of a larger audience, hopefully 2013 will see more people opening their ears up to the young Canadian. Check out <em>Patience</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F64299096\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18137-new-noble-oak-patience","category":"mpfree","date":1350913946000,"wpid":18137,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":527,"src":"2012/10/201105290845238328.jpeg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAgEAACAQQBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAYREgUTMXGR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCj5vhnTsqlsrp2vbdYIuIa3lCxgDwvA7+ip1Ni9ykzr31PFiNsNk+zSlQKl8HJQMi7/9k="},"createdAt":1587284594546,"updatedAt":1588403535708,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/10/201105290845238328.jpeg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
