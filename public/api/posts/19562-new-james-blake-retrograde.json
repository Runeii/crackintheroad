This new cut, <em>Retrograde</em>, restores this faith in a way few could have anticipated. Without being overly gushing, there’s something strained, vital and ultimately damaged to this new single that I haven’t heard yet in <strong>Blake</strong>’s work thus far. It sounds like something that needed to be made rather than a piece of music that was painstakingly and dedicatedly put together. Sure it’s masterfully produced, but that seemed purely coincidental. This is world shattering and achingly honest music that transcends those thick synths James uses that we all bloody love so much.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYdBqFhZVlI\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/obvw0ObjGaM\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19562-new-james-blake-retrograde","category":"music","date":1360316123000,"wpid":19562,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284022760,"updatedAt":1588441770814,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/02/james-blake-925x520.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
