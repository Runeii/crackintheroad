Where his highly recommended debut EP <em><strong>No Bloke</strong></em> took a more straightforward glo-wave direction, this new cut appears to be trialing new sounds and methods, to sumptuous effect. With more new material on the way, and a debut physical release just around the corner, I’m eagerly anticipating watching <strong>Noble Oak</strong> spread his branches.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F32102269\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F32102269\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nobleoak/the-mydriatic-sea\">The Mydriatic Sea</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nobleoak\">Noble Oak</a></span></p>\n","slug":"13439-new-noble-oak-the-mydriatic-sea","category":"mpfree","date":1325467012000,"wpid":13439,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293169118,"updatedAt":1588441784835,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/d62bca342de00a78408355ad46e1c6bd152bf02d.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
