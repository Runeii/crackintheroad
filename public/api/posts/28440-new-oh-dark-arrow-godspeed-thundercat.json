Dark Arrow – godspeed thundercat","content":"<p>Some fresh hip-hop from Cape Town, a part of the world with a wealth of hip-hop, most of which I haven’t dipped my toes into yet.</p><p> <strong>Oh! Dark Arrow</strong> are a great start. The production isn’t too dissimilar to the work of <strong>Hot Sugar</strong>, coupled with the darkness of say,<strong> Ibn Inglor</strong> (at least at points). The flows address this tonal dexterity wholeheartedly. Funky, fun and at times rambling, their rhymes hold the same weirdness as <strong>Young Fathers</strong>, while holding onto the laid back early 90’s vibes found in early <strong>Digable Planets</strong> material. All in all, more than enough going on to warrant a full listen to their debut mixtape/LP.</p>\n<p>Pretty eager to hear more.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/33963092&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"28440-new-oh-dark-arrow-godspeed-thundercat","category":"music","date":1399567234000,"wpid":28440,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282152075,"updatedAt":1587825848993,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","categories":["music","new"]}
