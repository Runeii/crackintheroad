Featured on a split 12″ single alongside a new track from another CitR favourite, Tessera Skies, O’Hanlon’s contribution is a gorgeously blossoming number, weaving his intimate lyricism between rousing, euphoric instrumentation. There are few artists around at this moment in time capable of conjuring up such a magical and moving atmosphere throughout an entire song.</p>\n<p>Not only marking the radiant reappearance of Ajimal, it also marks another stepping stone for <a href=\"https://www.monoproduction.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Mono</a>, the North East collective of artists led by Mick Ross, Jonathan Hamilton and James Hennin, through who the double A side vinyl will be released. Check out Nothing Touches Me below, out 1 December 2014.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/171916285%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-jOHEp&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Ajimal Tour Dates:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thurs 16</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> October: King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, Glasgow w/ Woman’s Hour</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tues 21</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>st</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> October: The Islington, London (Free Communion/Transmission headline show)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sat 22</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> November: High & Lonesome Festival, Leeds</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Sun 7</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> December: The Sage, Gateshead w/ Jo Hamilton</span></p>\n","slug":"30084-premiere-ajimal-nothing-touches","category":"music","date":1413191654000,"wpid":30084,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281835647,"updatedAt":1588441753767,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/027e439a714e044125cf2e7db372d2449ce02881.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
