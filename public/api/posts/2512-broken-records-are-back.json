Filled with violins and trumpets and writing grand anthems about love and loss, they quickly drew many comparisons to Arcade Fire. Whether or not this a comparison people will still be making after their second album, the newly titled <em>Let Me Come Home</em>, remains to be seen, but we already have our first taster. Released on 25th October 2010 on 4AD in the UK and Europe, you can download the opening track from the album, ‘<em>A Leaving Song</em>‘, from their website, <a href=\"https://www.brokenrecordsband.com/\">here</a>. Two members, David Fothergill and Arne Kolb, are also leaving the band, and Craig Ross will be joining them on bass guitar. Promising a UK and Europe tour announcement soon, and with Tony Doogan producing their new album, all eyes are on the Scottish band who, after having recently supported <strong>The National</strong>, are surely set for even bigger things in the near future.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://brokenrecordsband.com/br/mt-tb.cgi/190\" target=\"_blank\">Download ‘A Leaving Song’.</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_12524833.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"2512-broken-records-are-back","category":"music","date":1281710231000,"wpid":2512,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":400,"src":"2010/08/br.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAJBAAAgAEBAcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMAAgURBAYhMQcSExQiQVH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhJB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDPEcWMyupZw/eJUZklYKV9O0txtYb6WvuPURzsx1FrmMZWsVzzzGabwB1J+2hCHVPpKhH/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587295049538,"updatedAt":1588403564726,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d14","old_image":"2010/08/br.jpg","categories":["music"]}
