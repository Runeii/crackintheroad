Sure there are limits, but the list was as long as my arm. K-pop, gothic soul, steam punk aquatic inspired folk; I’ll leave it there because the list is really long.</p>\n<p>And now this, not exactly K-pop but I can forgive him for that. His re-work of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shlohmo/215424843565?ref=ts\">Shlohmo</a></strong> track ‘<strong><em>Wen uuu</em></strong>’ dissolves, melts and surrounds the consciousness.
