He’s not there yet, however this new cut/video, <em>CNT HLP MSLF</em>, is no doubt edging him closer.</p>\n<p>Made with a scuffling and erratic set of samples and sounds, the cut has club ready banger written all over it, yet also manages to ride the bass/soul wave we’ve all being experiencing recently via it’s smooth as hell bridge that runs through the track.</p>\n<p>All in all, it gets a hell of a lot of things right, and that’s not even factoring the brilliantly out of place, cute as hell kid that features in the video, yet somehow it works. Still, we can’t complain, the cut is dope.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kHMpbmrvEaY\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F85143948%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-soSp5\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20568-video-premiere-ftse-cnt-hlp-mslf","category":"music","date":1364381455000,"wpid":20568,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283721157,"updatedAt":1588441767831,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/6d9a2043aa8a661da8916fba164f6eed973e3f41.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews","videos"]}
