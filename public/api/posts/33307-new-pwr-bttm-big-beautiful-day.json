Driven by an almost fearless self-confidence the song tackles the often daunting task of ignoring the words of  close minded men. Lines such as “my advice is to look incredible as you make their lives regrettable by being your damn self” and “curse everyone of you for telling me I cannot be who I want” instill the ultra possitive theme throughout and build excitement for the bands full project out on May 12th.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDn4ZCo0NOU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33307-new-pwr-bttm-big-beautiful-day","category":"music","date":1487341289000,"wpid":33307,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2048,"height":1365,"src":"2017/02/pwr-bttm.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAfEAACAgIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAwACBCERBQYHEnH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBf/EABoRAAMBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEQAFIdH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJjuTyCunVHowbtONjXVVgaCKA1twfUDezyNyoLUEkmm/kRE8Eg17j3Zy5Y3v3f/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587279919881,"updatedAt":1588403502593,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"2017/02/pwr-bttm.jpg","categories":["music"]}
