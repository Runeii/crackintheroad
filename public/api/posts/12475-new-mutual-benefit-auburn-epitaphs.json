From the groups’ New York launch party, to the records blog-studded cast, the blogosphere really has a lot to talk about when it comes to Mutual Benefit. Their new single is due to be released on <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kassetteklub\">Kassette Klub</a></strong>, and also features an experimental track by <strong>Philip Seymour Hoffman</strong>, a track <strong>Mutual Benefit</strong> easily outshine.</p>\n<p>The track, <strong><em>Auburn Epitaphs</em></strong>, is a committed and charming folk gem. It floats with a graceful and sparse sensibility, sounds echoing and bouncing in the angelic yet cavernous space. In terms of genre, it sits gently between folk and benign surf-pop, yet as with all <strong>Mutual Benefit</strong> releases, it’s better to relax and just let the music transport you. Which is exactly what I’m planning to do.</p>\n<p>Stream and D/L the tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1582001109/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12475-new-mutual-benefit-auburn-epitaphs","category":"music","date":1320987867000,"wpid":12475,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293505218,"updatedAt":1588441786755,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/80549fa0edfb5b7c0188431865b71c745cce704b.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
