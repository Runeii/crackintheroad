It’s become a worldwide and genre-spanning interest, and some producers like <strong>Philip D Kick</strong> (more often known as <strong>Om Unit</strong>) and <strong>Machinedrum</strong> have decided to re-work jungle classics into footwork anthems.</p>\n<p>Well now experimental toe-dipper <strong>Daedelus</strong> is trying his hand at it, and the results are brilliant. Reworking the 1998 original, leaving in the organs and jazz angles, and even some of the face-melting bass synth, but lifting the tune from its jungle drumming roots and chopping it up juke style instead. The sampled female rap vocals top things off nicely – a nod to the Chicago producers who helm the movement. I can see an interesting convergence of old jungle heads and new-school footwork enthusiasts making a big thing of this stuff. It’s spreading like wildfire – and not a bad way. This is an interesting (brief?) change of pace for <strong>Daedelus</strong>, and I’m wondering where he’ll turn to next.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Daedelus’ remix of Reaction Time below.
