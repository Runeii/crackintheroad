New single <em>She</em>, taken from their forthcoming debut EP Blush, is a real 90’s throwback, with shades of <strong>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong> and, dare I say<strong> Rage Against The Machine</strong> amidst the rumbling bassline and shrieking guitar riffs. Check it out below, and pre-order the EP from <a href=\"https://www.roughtrade.com/albums/75795\" target=\"_blank\">Rough Trade</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F105411028\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23872-new-wolf-alice-she","category":"music","date":1376571223000,"wpid":23872,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":629,"src":"2013/08/551025_496410860408231_1617027433_n-950x629.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAjEAABAwMCBwAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQMEAAURByISFDFBQlFh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwX/xAAbEQACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMBBBETMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8ApdNcXY9uZmW0GnYSuOBvAhUjFFLg+DhRTp2zmp23XV1y3RTlQonME0BOYNxNyomfH3SlSprCB6cwLuZT/9k="},"createdAt":1587283076908,"updatedAt":1588443767452,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/551025_496410860408231_1617027433_n-950x629.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
