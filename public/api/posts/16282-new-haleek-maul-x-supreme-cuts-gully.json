You knew that, I knew that and frankly anyone who’s read a blog over the last few months knows that. The age of the dude is irrelevant. What’s important to stress is that <strong>Maul</strong> could possibly be one of the most talented wordsmiths of our time. I Remember when I first got into music criticism, a friend told me that the one thing any young writer should avoid is delving into hyperbole too readily; both negatively and positively.</p>\n<p>Sometimes things are average, and it’s ok to say that.</p>\n<p><strong>Haleek Maul</strong> however is a different story.</p>\n<p>His new track, <strong><em>Gully</em></strong>, with <strong>Supreme Cuts</strong> taking on the production duty, is a heartbreakingly self-deprecating, confused, angry, abused and frustrated odyssey. At times it sounds like a suicide note, at others a list of hostage demands. It’s hard to stomach, it’s hard to digest, sometimes it’s fucking hard to enjoy. But my god, it’s fucking exciting.</p>\n<p>Hit play.</p>\n<h5><strong>“No girl, I am not ok. Just settle down and give me head. Fuck this world, why was I born, wanna kill myself. Girl give me head.”</strong></h5>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F43262891&auto_play=false&show_artwork=false&color=000000\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16282-new-haleek-maul-x-supreme-cuts-gully","category":"music","date":1335942054000,"wpid":16282,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":336,"src":"2012/05/gully.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAYAAAD68A/GAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA10lEQVR4nCXPOU7DQBhA4SHM/DMJNrGyIExF2LzHsRUjiEBQkRRhqRDXAFFCxzkouEKulZ7yIZELPH1PJetfej8rvGrBwV6O6ARjEozLMTrGejPEn6E6iw+kf0MYXjMKCqxJ0NsRrtvgggta0uB2zlFWZ1g3ponmFL1NUUxMy5ZMHz+JzpYoNUIN/Sn7riR0FV2bIybFbxe0t44pJ8+8vn9Tx/eoYnDFSXDJrh6jTfzvc5Ix6EzoS8bD0xfzuzdUffpCfbTkcHiLSLoZMSnWZDid4NkKJyV/cqZVWfHmnOMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"createdAt":1587290471186,"updatedAt":1588403539659,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/05/gully.png","categories":["music","new"]}
