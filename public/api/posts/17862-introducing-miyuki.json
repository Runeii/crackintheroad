Whether it’s a the fault of the music industry for overlooking the fairer sex, or indeed there is a dearth of talent in that field, Russian producer Lera aka <strong>Miyuki</strong> deserves to stamp her authority on the genre with her new EP<em><strong> Ghostly Vibes</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Mixing her own vocal abilities with film samples and<strong> Burial</strong>-esque production, it’s an unrelenting and truly fascinating listen, inviting the listener into a vibrant mirage of epic proportions. EP closer <em>Dreamy Mind (Feat. Jan Amit)</em> is as good as any dubstep I’ve heard in 2012, whilst the languid Things We Left Behind is beauteous and menacing in equal measures. With a host of other tracks available on her <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/miyuki-sounds\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>, <strong>Miyuki</strong> is a name you’re going to want to listen out for; this girl is <strong><em>seriously</em></strong> good.
