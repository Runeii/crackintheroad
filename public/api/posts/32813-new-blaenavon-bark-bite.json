With recent single <em>Let’s Pray</em> gaining serious online traction and proving a recent favourite at live shows with The Hunna (we can forgive them for that), they’ve released another taster from the LP. <em>My Bark Is Your Bite</em> is another indie-crossover in waiting, and a recent addition to their electrifying live set – which, in truth, is now one of the strongest I’ve seen in recent times. This debut album is shaping up to be rather special. Check out My Bark Is Your Bite below.</p>\n<p>Like this? Follow our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02\" target=\"_blank\">On Repeat Playlist</a> for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aihODf3VrvA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"32813-new-blaenavon-bark-bite","category":"music","date":1475515844000,"wpid":32813,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587279990007,"updatedAt":1588442050827,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2016/10/blaenavon1015_gullickq8a3845_1290_860.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
