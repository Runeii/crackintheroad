{"id":"5e9c0006774c2610387e45e0","artists":["5e9b69257a1236eccfeb236d"],"title":"Introducing: Mystery Mountain","content":"<p>So often when we’re presented with a new band nowadays, it’s actually a project that’s been in the works for months on end (sometimes even years), with an over-zealous manager/A&R/label behind the scenes helping to craft every element to their own wishing.</p><p> The days of watching a band grow online, in the way that say, Arctic Monkeys did, has gone. From early demos to hit singles, it’s a process that’s disappearing rapidly, as artists become afraid of putting out material that isn’t 100% their utmost best, for fear of it tagging along with them for life. Perhaps it’s part of what I love about Stockholm’s <strong>Mystery Mountain</strong>, they don’t feel complete, the recording is rather rough around the edges, the drum samples are, well, let’s just say rigid to put it kindly, yet there’s a magic to their first four tracks.</p>\n<p>There’s ambition to their as an yet untitled EP, and by ambition, we’re talking verging on stadium filling songs, if not quite Coldplay, then definitely Embrace or The National. <em>Brave</em> couldn’t be anymore suited to Bono’s vocal if it tried, shimmering guitars and a songwriting talent that is too often missing nowadays. Check out my two favourites below, and the full EP underneath that.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=946678898/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=945654760/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"https://mysterymountain.bandcamp.com/album/untitled\">Untitled by Mystery Mountain</a></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=946678898/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=563364666/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"https://mysterymountain.bandcamp.com/album/untitled\">Untitled by Mystery Mountain</a></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 588px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=946678898/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"https://mysterymountain.bandcamp.com/album/untitled\">Untitled by Mystery Mountain</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29726-introducing-mystery-mountain","category":"introducing","date":1409818249000,"wpid":29726,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1200,"height":1184,"src":"2014/09/a3996390013_10.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgMF/8QAIBAAAgAGAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQSITEFURETIv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAD/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDd4amlSZbOgGxmEI5WWoC2DGNiAlE7+hDc3kjuIu73t9NvuDOOlQoOQbiaBd//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587281926812,"updatedAt":1588403515500,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/09/a3996390013_10.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
