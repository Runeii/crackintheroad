As with their debut EP, Medusa, and with all of their output, be it visual or sonic, it’s orchestrated with the utmost class, dignity and beauty. This is why GEMS are my new favourite band. Subscribe to their mailing list <a href=\"https://gems-band.us5.list-manage2.com/subscribe?u=ecfd0b66f94a487b239a4429c&id=b1447a3081\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and check out Don’t Cry below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/130885892&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"26345-new-gems-dont-cry-seal-cover","category":"mpfree","date":1390576314000,"wpid":26345,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2014/01/artworks-000068733367-w5sr1q-t500x500.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIFB//EACAQAQACAgEEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECEQAEAwUSISIxcZH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AwXpmpqbXQ97Z5OPXNrUYUT55cZKCPntr2bA8Jdn3kSU2Ul7Ylt0RAMITlEmRlIJFSB+Sxp/DFwP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282494792,"updatedAt":1588403520479,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/01/artworks-000068733367-w5sr1q-t500x500.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
