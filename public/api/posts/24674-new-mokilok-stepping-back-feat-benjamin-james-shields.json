Benjamin James Shields)","content":"<p>Yet more slick, electronic music from Australia,<strong> Mokilok</strong> aka producer <strong>Reede Reynolds</strong> impresses on his heavily R&B orientated debut track, <em>Stepping Back</em>.</p><p> Featuring the vocals of <strong>Benjamin James Shields</strong>, <em>Stepping Back</em> has everything; groovy synth sections and an almost danceable beat, all topped off by Shields’ vocals. Comparison wise it’s a difficult one – I won’t be shocked if you’d told me that Bondax or Lapalux had produced this, it has that sort of vibe, and certainly that level of quality. Check out <em>Stepping Back</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/114485120\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24674-new-mokilok-stepping-back-feat-benjamin-james-shields","category":"mpfree","date":1382226107000,"wpid":24674,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282858601,"updatedAt":1587825861789,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
