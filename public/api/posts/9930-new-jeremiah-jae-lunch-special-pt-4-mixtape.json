The new Mixtape, <strong><em>Lunch Special Pt. 4</em></strong>, gels together warm avant-garde beats with mind-bending word play and a dark sense of humour, to form something as baffling as it is groove filled. Throw in the fact that <strong>Natural Cure, Flying Lotus, Raga</strong> and<strong> Projeck</strong> all had a hand in producing the Mixtape, and you’re no doubt sold. Even if you’re not, it’s free, so you might as well be.
