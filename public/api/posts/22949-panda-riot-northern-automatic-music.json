That’s how they seem to work: well crafted instrumentation in a strong pop-framework, from the brilliantly produced moment when the initial guitar kicks in in <em>Mtwn Glass</em><em> </em>to the not-just-a-minute-of-filler-noise instrumentals <em>Encrypted Wilderness </em>and <em>Golden Age.</em></p>\n<p>At any rate, they’ve just announced that 300 copies of the album are to be pressed on to vinyl, designed in the style of old Folkway records from the mid-20th century and sold online.</p>\n<p>Give it a listen/buy a copy from the player below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 537px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=103041552/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/package=3757544795/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22949-panda-riot-northern-automatic-music","category":"music","date":1373432673000,"wpid":22949,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283294932,"updatedAt":1588441764641,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"generated/c020c693fdd6e7eb43aadb7996e2544f4d8a848f.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
