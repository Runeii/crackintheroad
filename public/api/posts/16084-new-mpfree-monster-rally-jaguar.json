Saying that, it’s pretty casual listening, almost like glorified lift music – not in a negative way, mind. There’s something meditative about the way the producer over-repeats the same sample, as if the record is stuck, intensifying your listening upon each repeat.</p>\n<p>I say all this, then I give you access to download a standalone track – though maybe it will sway you to listen to more, or to buy his album in the summer. Enjoy.</p>\n<p><em>Cop the track Jaguar below. You can also stream it. Fancy that!</em></p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F42789199&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true&color=000000\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></center></p>\n","slug":"16084-new-mpfree-monster-rally-jaguar","category":"mpfree","date":1334766106000,"wpid":16084,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292543994,"updatedAt":1588441779003,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/7bfe325f7095cb67be089b93104419bb1e66b7f6.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
