BILLIONAIRE is London’s (Whitechapel) John J Sterry, lead singer of Gaoler’s Daughter, who’ve played with Babyshambles and Graham Coxon as well as receiving support from Zane Lowe. Sterry’s two solo tracks, <em>Tammy Paints Pictures / Trustees</em> and <em>Poverty Line</em> are jerky, odd-pop gems, never quite settling on a specific genre or trend, cavorting wildly through psych-rock and almost Talking Heads-esque chorus sections. Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><em>I steal my neighbour’s roses / drive a car that’s older than Moses</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141000556&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141703867&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27666-introducing-billionaire","category":"introducing","date":1395969948000,"wpid":27666,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282287257,"updatedAt":1588441759492,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/dee1964007f665598489688a8d1959c5f718f4fd.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
