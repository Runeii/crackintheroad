Having created a track with boundless energy, a relentless beat, and plentiful transcending synths, Victories at Sea are certainly a band to watch out for this year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74219562\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19044-new-victories-at-sea-stay-positive","category":"music","date":1357808601000,"wpid":19044,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284205406,"updatedAt":1588441772044,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2013/01/cropped-950x729.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
