Coleman Hell & Jayme)","content":"<p>Okay, so bear with me for a second, this is a very un-CitR style track to be posting on these pages, but it’s just absolutely perfect in a cheesy, impossible-not-to-love way.</p><p> So first and foremost, it’s pretty much ‘house music’ (whatever that means anymore nowadays), it references a plethora of summer related cliches (‘swimming in our underwear’, ‘stick our toes into the sand’ ‘sleeping bags under the moon’), and features one of the most addictive hooks of the year; so all in all, it’s a sure-fire hit. Had this been two or three months earlier, you would have been expect a label to pick this up, rush-release it big, and it to be stuck on the radio for weeks to come. Hell, we’ve always got summer next year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/157891448&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29192-new-lach-summer-feat-coleman-hell-jayme","category":"music","date":1405800136000,"wpid":29192,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":800,"src":"2014/07/10489841_590305737750968_8063197098320777349_n-960x800.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUI/8QAHRAAAQQCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEEcQUSIf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM14x4sRRjJblOkNdywih6boapTtIiTbr//Z"},"createdAt":1587282043021,"updatedAt":1588403516258,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/07/10489841_590305737750968_8063197098320777349_n-960x800.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
