(Not technically about the music….)</p>\n<p>So, with all that said, why am I then writing about them? Well, because somehow, they’re just plain and simply awesome.<em> I Want To Be With You</em> is three minutes of frantic, upbeat indie pop, dripping with sickly sweet honey and lashed with half a kilo of sugar. Elsewhere on their debut EP, entitled <em><strong>LIFE</strong></em>,  you can expect much of the same; the <strong>Joy Division</strong> bassline of <em>Growing Old</em> and the jagged riff of <em>You Think You Know It All</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40076704&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I want to be annoyed at the pure simplicity of the tracks, but I just can’t, although the spoken sentence’s at the start of several of the tracks (<em>‘Some people think they know how to live their lives’</em> – <em>You Think You Know It All</em>) are intensely dis-likeable, coming across as an even more cliched sample from Skins. Think <strong>The Maccabees</strong>, <strong>Cajun Dance Party</strong>, and of course <strong>The Drums</strong>, and you begin to understand the sort of harmless, guitar pop vibe that <strong>The Mono Polys</strong> strive for, and perfectly achieve.</p>\n<p><em><strong>LIFE</strong></em> is out now, check out a couple of tracks in this article, and head over to their <a href=\"https://themonopolys.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp </a>to grab the full EP.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40076902&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15699-introducing-the-mono-polys","category":"introducing","date":1332187248000,"wpid":15699,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292648158,"updatedAt":1588441779907,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27368d3de3317e0b0b7835a0ad1.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
