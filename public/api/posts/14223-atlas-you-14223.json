Whilst the first couple of minutes allude to <em>ATLAS</em> being a slightly niche, female fronted folk outfit, it’s not until <em>You</em> really kicks in that you feel the full force of the track. Obvious comparisons can be drawn to the likes of <strong>Massive Attack</strong> and <strong>Portishead</strong>, yet it’s the post-rock influence that intrigues me, with the tender sound of <strong>Meanwhile, Back In Communist Russia</strong> plastered all over <em>You</em>.
