{"id":"5e9c0175774c2610387e477b","title":"Exhibition Review: Benedict Drew: Heads May Roll, Matt’s Gallery","content":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is <strong><a href=\"https://www.</p><p>benedictdrew.com\">Benedict Drew</a>’s</strong> first solo commission show at <a href=\"https://www.mattsgallery.org\"><strong>Matt’s Gallery</strong></a> in Mile End, London. He has created an exciting and sensually stimulating installation. Battering you with a head-swelling, over-exposed look deep into the world of LCD screens, he explores the ever-increasing use of digital technologies.</p>\n<p>As I was walking through <strong><i>Heads May Roll</i></strong> I started to realise that it is almost too fitting… while I am reviewing an exhibition that focuses on ideas of over digitalisation for an online blog, it dawned on me, that I will only be fulfilling Drew’s premonition.</p>\n<p>Drew describes the internet as “<strong><em>a vast seemingly infinite space that I don’t understand but I am drawn to like a moth to a light. Its vastness and complexity point to a notion of the sublime, but it’s also kind of ridiculous as well.</em></strong><b>’’</b> – <strong> <a href=\"https://www.benedictdrew.com/works/DREW_POSTER_ARTWORK.pdf\">Ellen Mara De Wachter</a></strong> interviewing <strong>Benedict Drew </strong>during his previous show at the<strong> Zabludowicz Collection</strong> <em>Jan 2012.</em></p>\n<p>I can see the same relation trickling though when looking at works like  <a href=\"https://www.benedictdrew.com/balloon_and_cymbal.html\">Balloon & Cymbal</a> ( 2009), <a href=\"https://www.benedictdrew.com/wah-wah.html\">THE WAH-WAH SHOE</a> (2010) and <a href=\"https://www.benedictdrew.com/works/materiel.html\">Matériel</a> (2013) we can see ideas that Drew relates to the internet in his own work: infinite, vast, complex, sublime and ridiculous while also having this presence that the piece can be continual yet have several cuts or edits much like surfing the web. I feel Drew continues this internet like ramble though <em>Heads May Roll</em> creating an installation that through each room I felt I was at the same computer yet the website, the office and all its surrounding had changed.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_27404\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-27404\" class=\"size-large wp-image-27404 \" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2014/03/2014_02_21-06-640x426.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Drew, Heads May Roll (2014).

At this point I didn’t know what to expect. All I saw as I peered through the opening door was a clinically white space and all I heard was a pulsating, waning drone of sounds similar to the work of the French poet <a href=\"https://youtu.be/B7BKD66Q90A\"><strong>Henri Chopin</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Once inside, the room felt futuristic and sterile with its corrugated plastic walls, tiled floors and even larger tiled lighting above. As I placed on the headphones, the noise seemed to be in an out-of-sync/ in-sync relation to the video in front of me. It was a chaos of sounds, with beeps layered upon each other in alternate tempos, covered by a computerised female voice that skips through words and phonics. This inner-ear experience blended dynamically with that of the outer-headphone Chopin-esque sounds that were filling the room</p>\n<p>The vibrant high-definition video starts; I heard tranquil vibes supporting spoken text ‘lets imagine for a moment’; I then start the journey into the screen, absorbing me with sounds and heavily textured objects, the piece is playing with all of my senses through a digital technique, almost migraine like.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_27413\" style=\"width: 425px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-27413\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27413  \" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/ice.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Drew, Heads May Roll (2014).

All of these images and short clips are juxtaposed and spliced together with jumpy edits, skipping and repeating as I delved deeper into the journey. I feel as though Drew brings up questions about the removal of the artist’s hand through new technologies, that there is now a shift from the hand as the producer to the keyboard or screen? The hand has been completely cut off; it is no more part of this world or the world Drew is forming. We now use our hands more as a stylus while gazing at screens using screens for more and more forms of communication until our brains become mush!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_27407\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-27407\" class=\"size-large wp-image-27407 \" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/2014_02_21-14-640x438.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Drew, Heads May Roll (2014).

By the end of the exhibition my senses and mind felt like it had too much and was almost exhausted… but in a good way. While I try to escape from the slowly spoken, powerful god like figure of astronaut <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RF-P02rm89M\"><strong>Chris Hatfield</strong></a> looking over me, I encounter a red escape hole/portal as if I was looking out into earth that was 40 years in the future; All that I have experienced has happened to the ‘real world’. I want to escape but as I am looking through the red glazed hole on to the world I see it in ‘new light’, one not so appealing. . I feel this takes a slight nod to French philosopher <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard\">Jean Baudrilard</a>‘s</strong> idea of <strong>Disneyland</strong> in which we are given ‘the illusion of a real word, an exterior world, despite the fact that exact world is the exact image of the other…there is no need to enter the virtual double of reality – we’re already there…’ (1)</p>\n<p>I carry on through the next door to realise I’m back at the beginning, in the white room, I am in a loop lead to do it all again, unless I break free from this over digitalised world and remember the door that I entered from.</p>\n<p>Drew’s exhibition leads you on an exploration into an immersive world in which over saturated images are bombarded at you in vibrant colours burning into your eyes and a mash of digital sounds skipping, jumping and slowing.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_27408\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-27408\" class=\"size-large wp-image-27408 \" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2014/03/2014_02_21-17-640x426.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Drew, Heads May Roll (2014).
