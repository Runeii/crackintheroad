With new track<em> Blue Break</em>, <strong>Isaac</strong> picks up where<em> <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/11038-new-jamie-isaac-softly-draining-seas/\" target=\"_blank\">Softly Draining Seas</a></em> left off, simultaneously building tension and atmosphere through his sparsely decorated beats and haunting vocals. As in the two previous cuts, the piano plays a pivotal role in the formation of <em>Blue Break</em>; remaining a stunning constant amongst a wave of twisted dubstep inspired percussion samples and Isaac’s soothing lyrics. Stream <em>Blue Break</em> below, and head over to <strong>Isaac’s</strong> <a href=\"https://jamieisaac.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> for free downloads of the two previous tracks; <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/11038-new-jamie-isaac-softly-draining-seas/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Softly Draining Seas</em></a> and<em> <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10870-introducing-jamie-isaac/\" target=\"_blank\">Intro/Drowning Roots</a></em>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3577844455/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://jamieisaac.bandcamp.com/track/blue-break\">Blue Break by Jamie Isaac</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11354-new-jamie-isaac-blue-break","category":"music","date":1316368013000,"wpid":11354,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/327673_150008991755442_113389698750705_257061_28040228_o-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwEF/8QAIxAAAQMCBQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDEQAEBRITITEGByJBUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAED/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDEf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AME65srDCzZtHGxfnKJG3qZN/Q7TCcJWQHcM0EdRlgzjyLRiV+xNHa81KmpoMP//Z"},"createdAt":1587293817979,"updatedAt":1588403547569,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/09/327673_150008991755442_113389698750705_257061_28040228_o-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
