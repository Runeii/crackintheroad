Luckily, according to a recent announcement, <strong>Slugabed</strong>‘s gonna give us all a weekly advent calendar treat of an old unreleased track of his. And this is the first – another track about kittens by another hip-hop-head. Suck this, keyboard cat.</p>\n<p><em>Stream and download Kittens below.
