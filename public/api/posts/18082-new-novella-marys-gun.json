The track centres around <strong>Shangri-Las</strong> lead singer Mary Weiss and her encounters with the FBI, that eventually lead to Mary carrying a gun; voila, we have a song title. Not a bad track to start a small UK tour with; check their upcoming dates below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Mary’s Gun</em></strong> will be released on Italian Beach Babes on 26th November.</p>\n<p>OCTOBER<br />\n17 Take 5, Norwich<br />\n18 Louisiana, Bristol<br />\n19 Sound Control, Manchester</p>\n<p>NOVEMBER<br />\n16 The End Fest, Flashback Records, London<br />\n17 The Old Blue Last, London<br />\n30 Sixty Million Postcards, Bournemouth</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F63278179&show_artwork=true&callback=reqwest_0&_=1350411819703\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18082-new-novella-marys-gun","category":"music","date":1350408581000,"wpid":18082,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":109,"src":"2012/10/novella-165x109.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAHxAAAgIDAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBAAFEQYxEiFR/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABf/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM0a13ca2Wy19OMZV6qFl8pQDYsWTJs+Hol8hPg9c5ktvi+6tNnYrp2MUNJYsF6OiJ+x6P5jGCuknXAHS//Z"},"createdAt":1587284622539,"updatedAt":1588443772103,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/10/novella-165x109.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
