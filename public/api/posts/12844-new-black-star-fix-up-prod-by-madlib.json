Some of you may remember that last month, <strong>Mos Def</strong> (now calling himself <strong>Yasiin Bey</strong>) and <strong>Talib Kweli</strong> came back with new <strong>Black Star</strong> material with production from <em>the</em> purest of geniuses <strong>Madlib</strong>, debuting it live on US late-night chat show The Colbert Report (with help from <strong>J Rocc</strong>).</p><p></p>\n<p>Well now that tune, which went down well with fans, has been studio recorded for your pleasure – <strong>Dizzee Rascal</strong> would be chuffed (I assume they were quoting him here). You can stream it below, soulful backing track included – it should tease what the new album will sound like. I’m thinking the vocals might need to be mixed into the track a little, but for now this is looking great; this is the raw deal. Anybody else psyched for their comeback? I know I bloody am.</p>\n<p><em>You can stream Fix Up below, and purchase it via iTunes <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/fix-up-single-single/id483271718\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><center><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28921882&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28921882&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object></center></p>\n","slug":"12844-new-black-star-fix-up-prod-by-madlib","category":"music","date":1322244752000,"wpid":12844,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":629,"src":"2011/11/blackstar-950x629.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAIBAAAQQCAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDBAUAERIhIjEysf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIE/8QAHBEAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEEEiFx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDO1VvUM11JZtG9PlyY5jMiOtCLamyI+O9JtOXHv97yGZBN2W+4tNAZUjIlbb3xDa/KefpPWMYczJkll3kNk33w8VcLQxgDRQX/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293380478,"updatedAt":1588443777097,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/11/blackstar-950x629.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
