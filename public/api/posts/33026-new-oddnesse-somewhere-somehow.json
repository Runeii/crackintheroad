This is especially prominent in the chorus where a soft glistening synth piece sits sympathetically under layered vocals that make the bands opening single shimmer. Definitely one to keep a close eye on going into the new year.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F285161990&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33026-new-oddnesse-somewhere-somehow","category":"music","date":1481213994000,"wpid":33026,"isSticky":true,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":800,"src":"2016/12/oddnesse-1-900x800.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAJAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwMG/8QAJhAAAgECBAUFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFBhFRBxI2QXQVISKys//EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAYEQEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AGss4T63Nd20cdzLcrb80CxDVRJzqPnsuhPvvpUJcv4ukrqmGXkqqSBJFEWRxup7g9jWo4M9Wv45/SOl/LXTmFeJF9BTD6mKeZUjv/9k="},"createdAt":1587279945151,"updatedAt":1588403503362,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"2016/12/oddnesse-1-900x800.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
