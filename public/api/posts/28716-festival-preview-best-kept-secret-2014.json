{"id":"5e9c00b2774c2610387e46bc","title":"Festival Preview: Best Kept Secret 2014","content":"<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">A new addition to the ever-growing European festival circuit, <a href=\"https://www.</p><p>bestkeptsecret.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Kept Secret</a> debuted in 2013 and quietly but assuredly assembled one of the continent’s most impressive lineups. Glasto-headliners Arctic Monkeys, Mercury-winning Alt-J and the enigmatic Damien Rice all performed against the edenic backdrop of the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Safaripark+Beekse+Bergen+B.V./@51.519453,5.110001,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c6bf813c2fe70f:0x8bb58fccaff5a081\" target=\"_blank\">Beekse-Bergen</a> landscape. With a forest and swimming lake alongside the charming main arena, the mixture of arcadian and arcane proved a hit with those searching for the secret.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Come 2014 and the BKS team have built upon the impressive maiden outing, this time mixing the nostalgia of recently-reformed <strong>Slowdive </strong>& the festival nous of <strong>Interpol</strong>, <strong>Franz Ferdinand</strong> & <strong>Elbow</strong> with the pick of the industry’s most exciting new talent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Running across three days from Friday 20 June to Sunday 22, Best Kept Secret appears to understand the ethos behind hosting a welcoming and enjoyable event. With camping for three nights, a beach and an entire line-up dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.bestkeptsecret.nl/en/04/29/complete-food-line-up-for-best-kept-secret-2014/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">food</span></a>, the organisers have considered all desires in looking to provide ‘your perfect festival.’</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Almost 100 acts are set to feature across 5 different stages, yet it’s the depth of the line-up throughout that makes the festival such an attractive prospect, with a real emphasis on variety and quality. Peering further down the bill, Crack in the Road favourites <strong>Honeyblood</strong> and <strong>Woman’s Hour</strong> appear on the Saturday, and British breakthrough act of the year <strong>The 1975</strong> pop up on Sunday afternoon.

Acts play at alternate times on Stages 1 & 2, sparing you that agonising choice between the band you’ve had on repeat for three weeks, and the one you’ve loved for years. At BKS you can see them both. Scheduling is smart too, & a licence to play late ensures you can get your groove on to <strong>Star Slinger’s</strong> sample-infused off-beat bangers well into the early hours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\"></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142342151&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The culinary extravaganza accommodates all requirements (vega, vegan, organic, gluten -, sugar – and lactose free), and includes everything from English pies to Indonesian satay as well as their specially produced ‘<a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/mhlP_3uiRs/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Worst Kept Secret Hotdog</span></a>‘.
