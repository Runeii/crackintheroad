I know very little about Pale other then the fact they are a Alan and Lee; a London-based duo with a particular affinity for brooding electronic music and that fellow CITR writer, Andrew, called their last show “<a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/23630-new-pale-fearing-faces/\">the best night of the past year.</a>” High expectations indeed! I also know that I am absolutely obsessed with the music they have been releasing particularly Two Wrongs and newly-released, Rundown.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116832214″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar Sebright Arms its an incredibly intimate venue located in the basement of the adjoining pub. Think low ceilings, narrow walls and a stage that raises only 6 inches above audience level. Definite speak-easy vibes. During set-up synth/keyboardist, Lee, walked right through the audience breaking down the invisible wall between artist and audience. I know a band member walking through a crowd is hardly exciting, but it really illuminated the fact that Pale are anything but pretentious.</p>\n<p>In all honestly I was some instantly into the whole show that I completely forgot to write down the order of songs, but they killed all of the songs they’ve released to date and even treated the audience to a new, unreleased, track that fell perfectly into line with the dark, moody temperance I’ve come to love. I wish they had told us the name of the track because I will certainly be keeping my eye out for it. I know all of this sounds so vague, but seeing Pale live is an experience not something you want to take your eyes off of just so you can scribble some notes.</p>\n<p>In the middle of their set I realized that I was watching the beginning of an incredibly successive music career. The exact thought was actually “I’m gonna be able to tell everyone I saw them before they were famous”–a slightly snobby thought, but true nonetheless. There’s something particularly charming about the both of them. Alan is definition “swoon-worthy” and that was verified by all of the doe-eyes I counted in the room. Basically he’s like Jude Law meets Lou Reed. (Sorry ladies he’s married and gonna be a dad! Congrats x) Looks of course aren’t everything, but its a nice compliment when you can’t peel your eyes off the stage.</p>\n<p>In summation Pale is a band you’d be damned to miss.</p>\n\n\t\t<style
