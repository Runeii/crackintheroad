Wrong.</p><p> Sure, gone are the lad rock days of the nineties (take note,<strong> <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/9466-review-viva-brother-famous-first-words/\">Viva Brother</a></strong>), and the mass produced, X-Factor styled drivel that pollutes the charts makes it difficult for genuinely talented songwriters to blossom. However once you look beyond these menacing obstacles, there’s still a plethora of forward thinking musicians, who have no qualms about being primarily guitar orientated. No, I don’t mean the herd of NME poster boys such as <strong>The Vaccines</strong>, <strong>One Night Only</strong> or <strong>Kings Of Leon</strong>; I’m talking about those bands who are forging their own way in the music industry, through hard work and intelligent songwriting.</p>\n<p>Brighton’s <strong>Fear Of Men</strong> fit perfectly into this bracket; no more so than on new single <em>Ritual Confessions</em>, a lush summer anthem in waiting. There’s no punches held, as the track lurches between the jagged bass sounds, clean cut guitar lines and the slightly <strong>Be Your Own Pet</strong> influenced vocals. As <em>Ritual Confessions</em> nears it’s end, instead of dragging on laboriously with a forced and unnecessary chorus, it cuts and leaves the listener intent on hearing the track again in it’s gloriously entirety.
