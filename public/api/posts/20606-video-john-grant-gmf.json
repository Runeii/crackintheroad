While ‘GMF’ is a maudlin, folk-y pop song, the video finds the singer/songwriter in a far more jovial mood. The premise of the piece revolves around following the artist while he is going about his daily routine, which includes activities such as playing basketball, visiting a pet shop and throwing some shapes on a night out. The whole thing is good fun and was directed with some serious swagger by Lucy Luscombe. <em>Pale Green Ghosts</em> is out now on Bella Union.</p>\n","slug":"20606-video-john-grant-gmf","category":"music","date":1364400520000,"wpid":20606,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283713867,"updatedAt":1588441767726,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/b64c26b5c160932db46bd84c219f34f35275c5a0.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews","videos"]}
