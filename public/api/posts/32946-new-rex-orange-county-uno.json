In creating infectiously melodic instrumentation, Rex’s superb vocal delivery is further galvanized and the listener remains trapped within the angst pervading through his psyche.</p>\n<p>Rex’s totality in his musical ability and razor sharp social awareness makes him remarkably individual, and ‘UNO’ must only mark the sign of exciting things to come as more of his music makes it’s way into the world.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/293396007&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"32946-new-rex-orange-county-uno","category":"introducing","date":1479378842000,"wpid":32946,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587279965998,"updatedAt":1588442050318,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/e85ed2c96c618b12433c7e6126ccb7771b469f3e.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
