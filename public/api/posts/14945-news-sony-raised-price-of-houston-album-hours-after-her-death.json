Some people immediately placed the blame on Apple but it quickly emerged Sony, who own the rights to Houston’s back catalogue, were responsible for the price increase as wholesale prices dictate the sale price on iTunes. Apple have now restored the original sales price & Song has since issued an <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15060-news-whitneys-posthumous-price-rise-was-a-mistake-say-sony/\">apology for the price increase</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course capitalising off a musician’s death isn’t a new thing.
