His new effort, the damaged, synth-laden piece, <em>Raven Banner</em>, certainly sustains our excitement. It’s a disorientating thing, blooming suddenly, and then dramatically pulling the atmospheric rug from under the feet. Yet it also manages to find a thick and scratched up groove that’s as perverse as it is infectious.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73527338\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18941-new-vessel-raven-banner","category":"music","date":1357248916000,"wpid":18941,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284251157,"updatedAt":1588441772121,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/992f456214e3989ccff1f09fea95c164eb773001.jpg","categories":["music"]}
