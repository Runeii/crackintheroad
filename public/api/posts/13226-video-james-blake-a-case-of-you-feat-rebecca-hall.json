Rebecca Hall)","content":"<p>It’s been a bizarre year for <strong>James Blake</strong>, having been named amongst the infamous<strong> BBC Sound of</strong>… list at the tail end of last year, his debut album fell rather flat, and failed to make the impression many had predicted it would.</p><p> His major downfall was his decision to ditch the experimental side to his music, instead focusing on the precarious vocals that he’d so finely tuned; yet the songwriting left much to be desired. Anyway, with the year drawing to a close, <strong>Blake’s</strong> final output is an official video for his cover of <strong>Joni Mitchell’s</strong> <em>A Case Of You</em>. Filmed in London last week, the clip is like a more emotive <strong>James Blunt’s</strong> <em>Goodbye My Lover</em>, whilst maintaining a cringeworthy element of worn down cliches. Check out the video for<em> A Case Of You</em> below, which is taken from his recent EP <strong><em>Enough Thunder</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJDSueNSMJE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13226-video-james-blake-a-case-of-you-feat-rebecca-hall","category":"music","date":1324301409000,"wpid":13226,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":116,"src":"2011/12/jamesblake1-165x116.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMH/8QAIhAAAgEDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFBhEHEyFRYXGh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwC3FbT3KGNktLmaG8muY4IAkhVVYsBv09/K0JMFCqgMisQNie/mlKVgC//Z"},"createdAt":1587293232464,"updatedAt":1588443776774,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/12/jamesblake1-165x116.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
