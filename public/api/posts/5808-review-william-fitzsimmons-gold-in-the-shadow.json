I was aware of the use of his tracks at emotionally pivotal points in numerous American sitcoms, however had never heard a full record of his in it’s entirety. After a rather heavy evening the night before, in my fragile state I knew Gold in the Shadow was either going to be the perfect hangover cure or a serious headache causer.</p>\n<p>Gold in the Shadow is the fifth full length LP from Fitzsimmons, and with each release, his fan base is growing in number and range. Album opener and lead singer Tide Pulls From The Moon was the ideal concoction to lift my drowsy spirits, smoothly delivered vocals, complete with it’s yearningly addictive chorus, make for a fantastically mesmerizing listen. Fitzsimmons’ has one of those voices that melts your heart immediately; seductive, understanding and reassuringly comforting.</p>\n<p>There’s touches of Nick Drake in the cautious songwriting, majestic yet simplistic and enticing in sound. Beautiful Girl is a stunning ode to a angelically described woman, seemingly engulfed in the trauma of a depressive illness; “Unfurl your gown, a distant fuller skin, I knew you once” weeps Fitzsimmons. The theme of the tracks are all too human, instantly recognizable for the majority of listeners, failing relationships drawing comparisons to the changing of the seasons in a recurring image used.</p>\n<p>Whilst towards the end of the record it tails off, with What Hold and Blood and Bones feeling somewhat like filler tracks, before the magnificently honest title track closes Gold In The Shadow. It’s an apt title for an album that hides so much beauty within it’s dark lyrical realms, as shown on the Julia Stone featuring Let You Break, which plays with intertwining male and female vocals to brilliant effect. Stone’s vocals and harsh when compared to the soft soothing tones of Fitzsimmons, securing it as a sure fire album highlight. More recent likenesses will be drawn to the likes of Iron & Wine and Aqualung, two extremely successful musicians in their own rights, yet when Fitzsimmons is at his most alluring it’s truly an unparalleled spectacle.</p>\n<p>William put together a special compilation containing some of his favourite tracks; keep checking back for this over the next few days!</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8LF2Gq7Doe4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"5808-review-william-fitzsimmons-gold-in-the-shadow","category":"music","date":1301141917000,"wpid":5808,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294598245,"updatedAt":1588441789804,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/3c6a8484792e585152a6761bcb42bd2aa1cddba7.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
