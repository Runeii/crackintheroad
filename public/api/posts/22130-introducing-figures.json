With their explosive yet measured debut EP, titled <strong><em>Monsters</em></strong>, they prove their worth as songwriters, capable of penning both epic, stadium ready anthems (<em>Ghosts</em>) and more tender, heartfelt numbers (<em>How To Grow Old</em>), sandwiched between lead single <em>Stay</em>. From Jillian Medford’s versatile vocals to the hook heavy guitar riffs, Figures are a band with a very bright future ahead of them. Check out their debut EP below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F5207708\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22130-introducing-figures","category":"introducing","date":1369749100000,"wpid":22130,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":750,"height":750,"src":"2013/05/229095_330720407031320_2025134445_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgIH/8QAJhAAAgECBQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBBEABQYSIRNBFCMxMkJRUv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAhS55l9LqFrU53COVxks1aww2kYk8CJFzye3fC9GsdPdBeytSYbRY2PpbGOppKaSXmVOkkzlyYD9HFUiFeFT5UPZH4j6wH/9k="},"createdAt":1587283460608,"updatedAt":1588403529946,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/05/229095_330720407031320_2025134445_n.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
