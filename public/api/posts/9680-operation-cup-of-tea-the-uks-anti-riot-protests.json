We’re still unsure on the details about the specific charity organisation.</p>\n<p>As dawn breaks after a fourth day of rioting, there’s still evidence of anger fuelled violence across the UK. <a title=\"UK Riots 09-10 August\" href=\"https://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/blog/2011/aug/10/manchester-riots-uk-disorder-day-four-live\">The Guardian</a> reports looting and destruction in Manchester and panic on the streets of Birmingham. Shops and businesses around London have also closed early, despite little sign of trouble reports <a title=\"london riots BBC live blog\" href=\"https://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/blog/2011/aug/09/london-riots-day-four-live-blog\">the BBC</a>.</p>\n<p>Online, some people have a much cosier & covert plan of protest, although rumours are, it will involve kettling (I’m so sorry!) A <a title=\"anti riot protest\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=261568193854371\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> event with over 170,000 attendees has been set up in opposition to the riots sweeping the UK. The event calls for people around the country to ‘anti-riot’ by enjoying ‘a nice cup of tea at home.’</p>\n<p>The quintessentially British cup of tea also made an appearance on Saturday when Philippa Morgan-Walker, 25 and her husband, Jonny Walker, 31, <a title=\"tea on riot shield\" href=\"https://kyrill-poole.com/blog/photography/tea-in-a-riot-shield/\">poured cups of tea on a riot shield </a>for the police who were protecting their street in Camden, London.</p>\n<p>The event, organised by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/sampepper\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Pepper</a>, dubbed ‘Operation Cup Of Tea’ is sweeping social media with the hash tag <a title=\"tea anti riot protests\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23OperationCupOfTea\">#OperationCupOfTea</a> trending on twitter and over 800,000 invites sent out via facebook. The innovative event is set to continue until riots subside. Whilst the protest might not deter looters or put out fires, this anti riot protest shows solidarity of the British people, highlighting the fact it is a small minority out there causing trouble.</p>\n<p><a title=\"operation cup of tea facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=261568193854371\">The Operation Cup of Tea facebook page</a></p>\n","slug":"9680-operation-cup-of-tea-the-uks-anti-riot-protests","category":"life","date":1312962493000,"wpid":9680,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/08/operationcupoftea-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABv/EACUQAAIABAUEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFEQAGEyExBxIiMkFRkf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAl09yylQp8WpTcmGhRhpHUiEByCQVA21NvL6BUc4PTOVKUsxFEOWmewMQvdHANr/ItthFmtjL9O6okuTCSEsLTVPEJdhe1uOTg6Xa/sf3BMAKyl6F//9k="},"createdAt":1587294115907,"updatedAt":1588403551290,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d40","old_image":"2011/08/operationcupoftea-165x165.jpg","categories":["life"]}
