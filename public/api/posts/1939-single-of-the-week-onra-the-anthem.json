Before making the record Onra went to Vietnam, where his grandparents are from, and managed to bring back some 30 old Chinese and Vietnamese vinyl records. He then made a full album with this material; Chinoiseries, which is his most critically acclaimed album.</p>\n<p>The highlight is perhaps “The Anthem”, a piece of music that was later chosen for a Coca-Cola commercial at the Beijing Olympics. The piece is short, sharp and utterly infectious, taking influences from jazz and swing it creates a truly absorbing wall of sound layered with the most intricate of samples.  Three years later and the record is just as fresh as the day it was cut. Enjoy.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/jJBI4ckmB2M&hl=en_US&fs=1\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/jJBI4ckmB2M&hl=en_US&fs=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n","slug":"1939-single-of-the-week-onra-the-anthem","category":"music","date":1280064805000,"wpid":1939,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":548,"height":310,"src":"2010/07/onra.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQI/8QAHhAAAAYCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQREiEFMaH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDMTEwm+JlxDbSo3nG1kuitOOWr73fghABIV//Z"},"createdAt":1587295108215,"updatedAt":1588403565355,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2010/07/onra.jpg","categories":["music"]}
