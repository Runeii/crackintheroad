It’s for this very reason that I sympathize hugely with Californian troubadour <strong>Flatsound</strong>, a hugely talented songwriter in his own right, yet constantly and unfairly tarred with the <strong>Conor Oberst</strong> brush… or maybe it’s just a testament to the impact of<strong> Oberst</strong> that any emotionally connected male guitarist finds themselves stuck with slightly lazy comparisons.</p>\n<p>Now seven releases into his musical career, <strong>Mitch Welling</strong> aka<strong> Flatsound</strong> has slowly but surely built a loyal and engaged following, with the individuality, consistency and frequency of physical material being a contributing factor to this success. Most recent release<strong><em> Sleep</em></strong> is a record of two halves, one focusing on intimate, poignant songwriting, flourishing lyrically allowing the listener to develop a deeply personal relationship with<strong> Flatsound</strong> whilst the second half finds<strong> Welling</strong> experimenting with ambient, atmospheric sounds.</p>\n<p>Texturally it’s bliss, effortlessly utilizing the lo-fi aesthetic that numerous other acts strive for, but comes so naturally to<strong> Flatsound</strong>; no surprise really given that his bedroom doubles as his recording studio. If you’re looking for a record to perk you up, then <em><strong>Sleep</strong></em> may not be for you, with it’s dark imagery and almost obsessive nature (“<em>and this is where I die, oh I thought i was the best part of your life</em>“), yet there’s no doubting the solace many will find in the album. <em>To See You Alive</em> is a personal highlight of Side A, a track so desirably relatable whilst clearly only having real meaning for <strong>Welling</strong>.</p>\n<p>As with<strong> Flatsound’s</strong> previous releases, the DIY aesthetic suits the album perfectly, and with <strong><em>Sleep</em></strong> being released on cassette, the drone inspired latter half to the record works sumptuously. While it’s immediately apparent that tracks 1-7 will cut straight to the core, the likes of <em>You Know How To Make A Man Feel Useless</em> and <em>Consciousness</em> require repeated listens before they truly burrow into your thought processes. Now it’s not for lack of trying that I’ve written far less about the ambient tracks on <em><strong>Sleep</strong></em>, more that they are experiences, that defy simple explanations and insist upon full listens. With <em><strong>Sleep</strong></em>, <strong>Welling</strong> has shaken off any demons of unwanted comparisons, and has crafted an entirely unique, immersing record.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sleep</strong></em> is released 10 June via <strong>Flatsound’s</strong> <a href=\"https://flatsound.bandcamp.com/album/sleep\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>, check out a couple of highlights below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=606063166/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1125786619/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16530-review-flatsound-sleep","category":"album-reviews","date":1337200970000,"wpid":16530,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587288475200,"updatedAt":1588441778093,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/3487fe447b7c35050c12bd4a6c2858bf3575b6a4.jpg","categories":["album-reviews","new","music"]}
