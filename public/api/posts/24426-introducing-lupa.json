A classically trained violinist, her music shows a keen knowledge of harmony; <em>The Creature</em> is a choppy, whirlwind of Jones’ stunning vocals and a Grimes-esque chorus section which, if truth be told, lacks a little gusto in the production at times, yet showcases a wealth of talent and potential.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F110894262\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The track that really caught my attention is the folkier <em>The Infinite Colour</em>, that’s less quirky electronica, and more just out-and-out intelligent pop. Despite a few issues surrounding production, the talent is undoubtedly there, and with time (which<strong> Lupa</strong> has plenty of) and perhaps a little direction, there’s no predicting just how far<strong> Lupa</strong> could go.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F110893518\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24426-introducing-lupa","category":"introducing","date":1380481782000,"wpid":24426,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282931969,"updatedAt":1588441762019,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/adcc1cb654e89f2e404688ae0d1bbc942ce02e5d.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
