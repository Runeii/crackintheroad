There is no doubt the tragic loss of his father had a massive influence on Carner’s debut effort, with the fragile and highly emotional ‘BFG’ opening the EP  with a resilient, raw honesty. The remainder of the EP demonstrates a variety of influences and styles, employing sounds of jazz, blues, and soul, all of which is underpinned by Carner’s smooth and intelligent lyrical flow.</p>\n<p>This is one of our favourite EP releases of 2014, and we can’t wait to hear more.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/49134168&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29736-introducing-loyle-carner","category":"introducing","date":1409839244000,"wpid":29736,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":150,"height":150,"src":"2014/09/artworks-000089736012-4zml58-t500x500-150x150.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQQH/8QAIBABAQABAwQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABExBAUSIUFRcf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDDunx+XT2GK6tBlOOfe58+tSVNFJ4ps8JpPt1UY8aU7lgO/wC6NvJbSt1z96D/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587281923240,"updatedAt":1588403515444,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2014/09/artworks-000089736012-4zml58-t500x500-150x150.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
