A criminally overlooked artist in her own right, although her bands <strong>Rubies</strong> and <strong>Call and Response </strong>have gained more critical recognition, this track deserves it’s plaudits. Arty danceable folk and dream pop melodies surrounded by a ’60s flavored jazzy pop groove that will bend every cold heart, her vagrant voice is the vehicle that leads this evaporated, glorious groove back in time, a time when masterpieces were born out of spontaneity.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/125057135″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"25641-introducing-simone-rubi","category":"introducing","date":1389017811000,"wpid":25641,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":636,"height":596,"src":"2013/12/smo.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAJAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwUI/8QAKRAAAAMGAgsAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIFAAMEERMhEnMGBxQ1N1NhYqGxsv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAZEQEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIREvH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AFhU0khExSBOiX8XtZ6QuilckGrUNhACj2iEzTlIL3a7Tec849cJb+Gz1rK4poedE+mfUjdMFkE+QYVdjMdlOE//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282612759,"updatedAt":1588403522622,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d44","old_image":"2013/12/smo.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
