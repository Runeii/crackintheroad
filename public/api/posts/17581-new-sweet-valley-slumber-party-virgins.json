Check out <em>Virgins</em> below and keep your ears open for their debut album later in the year.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3899801729/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17581-new-sweet-valley-slumber-party-virgins","category":"mpfree","date":1343754849000,"wpid":17581,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":950,"src":"2012/07/3416733302-1-950x950.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUGB//EACMQAAIBAgYCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAEBQYREyExB0EyUmH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFBv/EABsRAAIDAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDAAEEFCFC/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAUuH2mVWit0gSScNuszj2dOqiMQzHI1/ckO2hlY9/ppt56mlXOuiyuBtrwGP2rPpmbek5PyPumc6F7htja7lDyjwgALvzU/9k="},"createdAt":1587284841546,"updatedAt":1588443772893,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/07/3416733302-1-950x950.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
