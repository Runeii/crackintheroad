{"id":"5e9c33a29b6559241525e0bc","title":"Review: AM – Self Preservation","content":"<p><em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Self Preservation</em> is the brilliant UK debut single from psychedelic San Francisco rocker <strong>AM</strong>.</p><p> After having his American only full length LP release named amongst the albums of the year in a poll by iTunes in 2006, it would seem nigh on impossible to live up to such high expectations, however, with a lead single like this, there is a jovial optimism about UK debut album <em>Future Sons & Daughters</em>.</p>\n<p>Raised in New Orleans, there are the obvious blues roots hidden amongst the upbeat indie rhythms, drawing comparisons to the likes of <strong>Jim James </strong>from <strong>My Morning Jacket</strong>, as well as <strong>Brian Wilson</strong> inspired harmonies. Recorded in the former apartment of genius songwriter Elliot Smith and coming in at little over three minutes long, <em>Self Preservation</em> is a scintillating pop gem. Sunshine melodies and intriguing, yet at times despairing lyrics make for a fantastic UK debut single, sure to catch the attention of music fans all over the country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_21nbNGSFg \">Watch The Video For Self Preservation</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"www.amsounds.com\">Check Out His Official Site</a></p>\n","slug":"1772-review-am-self-preservation","category":"music","date":1278595041000,"wpid":1772,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/06/0-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAYH/8QAIhAAAgEDBAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAwUGABESIUFRIjGh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAkDDceEvLMRTGxNnwFR4swx1Vg60SzKXA3PJ1IUEdg+NZZUttHm3DH+KbnYNFckD0fj96mo+UX9CzpfLornssJdQE+PegPlGQM7Fr5dSSdyTLqd/umaJc6z//Z"},"createdAt":1587295138336,"updatedAt":1588403565843,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/0-188x188.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
