In truth, the female vocals are slightly weak at times, but it’s the imperfections that make their two debut tracks standout. <em>Racing Hearts</em> is a fuzzy, surf pop tune, telling of love, loss and the turmoil that both bring about, whilst <em>Decay</em> is a rougher number, trundling along in a vaguely disgruntled manner. Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2395939151/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://sweetvalleyslumberparty.bandcamp.com/track/decay\">Decay by Sweet Valley Slumber Party</a></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1182532609/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://sweetvalleyslumberparty.bandcamp.com/track/racing-hearts\">Racing Hearts by Sweet Valley Slumber Party</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14942-introducing-sweet-valley-slumber-party","category":"introducing","date":1329146568000,"wpid":14942,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292853613,"updatedAt":1588441781819,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/a6969e135ac0408f62cf3be22923e945c0700780.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
