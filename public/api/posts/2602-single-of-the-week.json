Having remixed the likes of <strong>Coolrunnings</strong> and <strong>Fiveng</strong>,<strong> Darren Williams</strong> really showcases both his knowledge of excellent music, as well as his ability to produce innovative and stimulating songs.</p>\n<p><em>May I Walk With You </em>is the most recent offering from <strong>Williams</strong>, and again is a free download from his<a href=\"https://starslingeruk.bandcamp.com/\"> bandcamp</a> site, showing his never ending generosity and belief in the freedom of accessibility of music. Featuring a sample of the <strong>Life Without Buildings </strong>track <em>The Leanover, May I Walk With You</em> is a progressive and soulful experience, capturing the imagination and ears of the listener. An infectious hook repeats throughout the entire song, whilst the vocals complement the splendid beat; one of my tracks of the year so far.</p>\n<p><object width=\"480\" height=\"385\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/dhF8tgVE7tI?fs=1&hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"480\" height=\"385\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/dhF8tgVE7tI?fs=1&hl=en_US\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"2602-single-of-the-week","category":"music","date":1282569596000,"wpid":2602,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":680,"height":454,"src":"2010/08/star-slinger.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAHxAAAgIBBQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMBBAAFERMhMTJh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMv06o/V0VUV69flBfyADG4+dzP7kpiKSWEtnHBhMiUQgZ7j3vbGMD//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587295031462,"updatedAt":1588403564496,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2010/08/star-slinger.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
