With a beat that Miss Del Rey herself would be proud of, and a vocal delivery akin to everyone’s favourite sleaze-bag, <strong>The Weeknd</strong>, <em>Female Robbery</em> is one hell of a debut track. Aside from one slight slip up around the 1.45 mark, it’s fairly easy to see how this gem has already been featured on <strong>Radio 1</strong> and<strong> NME</strong>.
