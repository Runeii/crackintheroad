Because you know that <a title=\"...\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/springoffensive\">sitting at that desk</a> is a privilege, that it keeps you in records and beers and train tickets and the approval of your family. But you know that you knew at sixteen that you were going to be so much bigger than this and that there was nothing that could have stopped you then and all that’s really stopping you now is your own grey comfort. Propelled by a typically rangy percussive shuffle, those scrambling bumps and clicks that have become synonymous with this Oxford quintet<strong></strong>, <em>Worry, Fill My Heart</em> questions that comfort and finds, surprise surprise, no concrete answers. <strong>Spring Offensive</strong> are one of those rare bands that don’t need to turn their guitars up, or even play them all that much, to take your head off, the elastic relationship between the two Telecasters playing out as a paean to the band’s professed influences, Death Cab for Cutie’s gorgeous, burst-heart open chords, and the interlocking grooves of Wild Beasts’ <strong><em>Smother</em></strong>. That the song cuts out where many of a similar breed might burst into triumph or fury is both devastating and apt.</p>\n<p><em>I never thought that I would end up in a job like this. I’m an impulsive man so so so…maybe tomorrow I’ll go ahead and quit.</em></p>\n<p>Maybe not.</p>\n","slug":"15673-video-spring-offensive-worry-fill-my-heart","category":"music","date":1331976678000,"wpid":15673,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":600,"src":"2011/10/springoffensive.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAHxAAAQQBBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEAEhMhMWEG/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEAAf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Aws2VInNBmVtstuqKS1a749ro95MPzElZ1AFsK5CN+tPlVxjGC7ko3//Z"},"createdAt":1587292656130,"updatedAt":1588403541039,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2011/10/springoffensive.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
