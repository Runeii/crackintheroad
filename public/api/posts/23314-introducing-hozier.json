His wistful charm and tear inducing soulful warble is quite unlike any other artist around at this present time. On his debut EP, there’s the out and out brash, piano led balladry of <em>Take Me To Church</em>, alongside the lovelorn stammer of <em>Like Real People Do</em>. There’s an underlying feeling of religious betrayal, of the realisation that perhaps faith isn’t as silky as the books of old would have you believe, and it’s partially this that makes <strong>Hozier</strong> such an engrossing listen.
