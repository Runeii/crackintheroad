Whilst numerous artist appear able to impress blogs with their premiere releases, its takes more than that to build any form of career out of it, and on this EP <strong>W∆NR</strong> show that they have more than enough about them to create a level of sustainability. Check out the full EP below, especially the soulful standout track <em>The Finest Things</em> feat. back-up vocals from <strong>Ana Marcu</strong>, then download it on a <a href=\"https://wnrmusic.bandcamp.com/album/cityscape-ep\" target=\"_blank\">name your price</a> deal.
