However, Pleasure doesn’t leave fans worrying for long showing the benefits of a fresher grittier sound. A palm muted guitar intro starts the track gently with Feist taking vocal cues from contemporaries Karen O and P J Harvey as she works within the space of a more skeletal sound. The tracks development is euphoric after a gnarled solo guitar bridge with the 2nd verse building up instrumentally leading into one of the most feel good choral endings to a song you’ll have heard this year. Feist hopefully won’t wait too long to release what is now an even more hotly anticipated album.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h66Lvzlj1Uk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33426-new-feist-pleasure","category":"uncategorized","date":1490031012000,"wpid":33426,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1000,"height":1000,"src":"2017/03/5876c6792b1d147fd54a463ac7157a59.1000x1000x1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwX/xAAkEAABAgQFBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAUREhMhIkEGMTJhcf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEE/8QAGREBAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxEh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAgpVKlFSjq1sAlLeLEoEW1GoiQ4iVzFWCbXPMO86kDp4AADaO3yBl9Cc9zaPI8e4Ztv111coB1Ib//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587279895955,"updatedAt":1588403501825,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"2017/03/5876c6792b1d147fd54a463ac7157a59.1000x1000x1.jpg","categories":["uncategorized"]}
