Thankfully the now infamous Jay Elecronica has claimed my title, and to be honest we’re all a bit better for it.</p>\n<p>When choosing one Jay Elecronica track for the single of the week in many ways we were spoilt for choice. Although a full LP has never been officially released, the wealth of demos that have been released unconventionally on the internet is vast. So which one? Well, we thought we’d start where it all began with ‘act 1: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)’, a wildly ambitious and utterly original slice of hip hop. So absorb these nine minutes of perfection and remember the name Jay Elecronica, because you’ll be saying it a lot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.unpiano.com/music/wp-content/music/jay_electronica/the_pledge.mp3\">Download Jay Elecronica – ‘Act 1: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)’</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWc4DG1s53g\">Listen on Youtube</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/jayelectronica\">Check His Myspace</a></p>\n","slug":"946-single-of-the-week-jay-elecronica","category":"music","date":1274605150000,"wpid":946,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":449,"src":"2010/05/jay-electronica.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIRAAAQMEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDBAAFBhESExQhUVL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDI8Bg2u2YpdrjkkZkmZ0cuyJW+oZcFUS18Ly15X0tTkfC5kqO1ICXDAXRRxBIj2iKm9LoaUqaP/9k="},"createdAt":1587295249613,"updatedAt":1588403567468,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2010/05/jay-electronica.jpg","categories":["music"]}
