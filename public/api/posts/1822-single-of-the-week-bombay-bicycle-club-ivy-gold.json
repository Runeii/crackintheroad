This song will no doubt be a massive hit at festivals this summer- they are playing on the Red Bull Stage- and will no doubt be one of the highlights of any festival-goers weekend.</p>\n<p>The lyrics themselves are beautifully crafted to show further why this song will become one of this summer’s biggest successes, with such a upbeat chorus ‘you’re a layer of my clothes made of ivy and gold’. The delicate guitars and drums compliment the lyrics massively, allowing the melody to take hold of the listener. After listening to <em>Ivy & Gold</em>, I believe the album, <em>Flaws</em>, will become an equally massive success especially after their festival appearances at T in the Park, Oxygen and Glastonbury festivals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK2fWmsBUzk\">Watch an acoustic performance of Ivy & Gold here</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/bombaybicycleclub\">Check out their Myspace</a></p>\n","slug":"1822-single-of-the-week-bombay-bicycle-club-ivy-gold","category":"music","date":1278768322000,"wpid":1822,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":398,"src":"2010/07/bombay.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAIBAAAQMEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFERIGMQcTIf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAbEQEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIEEgMxQf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ai55n9FmiuWGc9LurT74eRI30DIWS2VZGFDKyCAdviR0K0bXfeYv2yI8JMVYcZQvZct8KOUg5OB3SlKxaHJZHyFyr6mwds//Z"},"createdAt":1587295127806,"updatedAt":1588403565711,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d07","old_image":"2010/07/bombay.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
