{"id":"5e9c083f774c2610387e5016","artists":["5e9b69177a1236eccfeb2294"],"title":"Stream: Little Lungs – Rebuild","content":"<p>Of the thousands of new artists I’ve listened to over the past twelve months, Chicago songstress <a href=\"https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/littlelungs2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Little Lungs</strong></a> is certainly up there in terms of potential to cross over from blog-popular to mainstream success. With her delicate vocals and as equally fragile composition, there’s a really intoxicating aurora to her music, that’s deeply personal yet still accessible.</p>\n<p>New EP<strong><em> Rebuild</em></strong> almost appears to be documenting the post-relationship haze; the acceptance, the moving on and the burning flares that point towards the future. With her Lana Del Rey / Nancy Sinatra drawl and simplistic yet haunting synth sections, the likes of <em>A Moment of Overwhelming Grief</em> and EP closer <em>Rebuild</em> showcase the under-produced pop that she does so well. Without meaning to sound condescending, nor taking anything away from her talent, with a greater production budget, there’s no telling where <strong>Little Lungs</strong> could end up.
