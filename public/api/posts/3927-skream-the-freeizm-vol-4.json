His <strong>Magnetic Man</strong> project, with <strong>Benga</strong> and <strong>Artwork,</strong> produced some of the biggest anthems of the summer and even inflicted bruising on a usually dub-free UK chart.</p>\n<p>Ask anyone who likes, or even ‘claims’ to like dub-step, and 9 out of 10 times they will mention <strong>Skream</strong>. It is his solo material though that has been most <strong>prolific</strong> and got him this increased recognition. 2010 saw the release of his second album, the critically acclaimed<strong> ‘Outside The Box’</strong>, along with 3 free mixtapes of his material and tracks remixed by the man himself. The Christmas period saw Skream at his most generous though, bringing the year to a close with <strong>Volume 4 </strong>of the <strong>Freeizm series</strong> via his Facebook page and giving our ears 13 bangers to help start 2011 in the right way. It’s not only dub-step sounds that are presented here either, <strong>‘Emotional Shizzle’</strong> bringing with it a drum and bass beat and a 90s vibe, and <strong>‘Intro’</strong> showing how nicely eerie noises and some deep bass can build up to something special. Highlights for me are <strong>‘Minor’</strong> and <strong>‘Lightning VIP’</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklisting:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Intro</p>\n<p>2. No Ready</p>\n<p>3.
