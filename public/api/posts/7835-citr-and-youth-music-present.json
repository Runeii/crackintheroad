A special mention should also be accredited to <strong>Bravestation</strong> who’s Talking Heads track we’ve included as a bonus track.</p>\n<p>When we originally contacted each band, we simply presented our idea to them and asked them to produce the best quality track that they could. With no funding other than money from their own backpockets, each band went away to produce their track with the facilities they had available to them. All of us agree, that after listening to the final result, we are hugely impressed by how enthusiastically each band approached the task that they so generously agreed to. Working from scratch, these bands did not simply go away to produce haphazard bedroom recordings, rather they produced professional recordings that all provide incredibly interesting takes on very well known (loved or hated) tracks.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned in our original announcement, we are not only releasing the compilation in celebration of our 1st Birthday, but to also raise awareness and money for <a href=\"https://www.youthmusic.org.uk/musicispower/index.html\"><strong>Youth Music</strong></a>. This fantastic charity does some truly amazing work with disadvantaged children and young adults, bringing musical equipment and activities to places which may otherwise may never have had the opportunity. Music is a truly special creative outlet, and we believe that with the impetus of creativity, a community spirit can be lifted immeasurably, thus in turn providing brighter, more fulfilling futures. It would be great to think that through our enjoyment and hard work putting this compilation together, the joy that music brings can be perpetuated through to those who gain a priceless reward from <strong>Youth Music</strong>‘s work.
