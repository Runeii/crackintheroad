Part serenade, part melancholic outcry, there is a strong indication in this latest effort that a step into a more mainstream audience is not only not too far away, but can be made with a confident motion.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/123015942&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25106-new-eaves-timber","category":"music","date":1386067969000,"wpid":25106,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/12/eaves1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwUI/8QAKRAAAQMDAQUJAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFIREGBxITQRUiIzEyQlFxkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME/8QAGBEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECESH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJWx+8S6Wm9wp3ary4PEVyY7ixo5qcj88vqlBzeldC4rkrZLep4SY+SOnWstxiU2hATjuqOPnUZpmZkP8lvxnPSPcakl0+aPMJn/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282732342,"updatedAt":1588403524481,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2013/12/eaves1.jpg","categories":["music","newnews"]}
