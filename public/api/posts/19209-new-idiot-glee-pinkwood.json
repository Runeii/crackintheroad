{"id":"5e9c08ad774c2610387e5064","artists":["5e9b69047a1236eccfeb215a"],"title":"New: Idiot Glee – Pinkwood","content":"<p>Idiot Glee’s 2011 debut LP <em><strong>Paddywhack</strong></em> went somewhat under the radar for most people, and rather unfairly so to tell the truth.</p><p> Whilst it perhaps felt slightly emotionally disjointed at times, it still showcased <strong>James Friley</strong> as one of the most naturally talented songwriters around. Fast forward two years, and Friley clearly hasn’t lost that ability, as demonstrated by his fantastic new track<em> Pinkwood;</em> a sultry, almost bluesy-R&B style number. Arguably the best track I’ve heard in the opening few weeks of this year, hopefully <em>Pinkwood</em> will open up the music of <strong>Idiot Glee</strong> to the audience that it so clearly deserves.
