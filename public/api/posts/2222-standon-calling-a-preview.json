From the experimental post-punk of Liars, to the Balkan folk of A Hawk and a Hacksaw, to the minimal electronic sounds of Pantha du Prince, Standon Calling’s line up is defined by one thing: talent. As well as the more experienced acts on the line up, Standon Calling boasts a wealth of new talent, including Crack in the Road interviewees <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/699-5-minutes-with-summer-camp\" target=\"_blank\">Summer Camp </a>and <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/872-harrys-gym\" target=\"_blank\">Harrys Gym</a>. But it is not just the line up that makes this advertisement-free festival so unique. Each year a different theme is selected, from last year’s intergalactic to this year’s ‘<em>Murder on the Standon Express</em>‘. Not only is the theme a cracking excuse for fancy dress, but it also bares an impact on set designs and art installations – Standon Calling claims to any artist, be they painters, sculptors or even chefs.</p>\n<p>It also promises toilets “so clean you could sleep in them” as well as a decent number of showers, which is hard to come by at festivals – any festival that appreciates people’s need for hygiene must be doing something right.</p>\n<p>It’s the little things that really make Standon Calling stand out from the rest, such as “Standon fairies” leaving a drink outside everyone’s tent in the morning. Other unique features of Standon Calling include a swimming pool guests can use, a more intimate atmosphere than most festivals, an all-night license, ensuring that the party really does continue all night and, er, a night club in a cowshed. That’s probably worth the entry price alone.</p>\n<p><em>Check back for band tips over the next few days.</em></p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_12228888.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"2222-standon-calling-a-preview","category":"festivals","date":1280736548000,"wpid":2222,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":150,"height":150,"src":"2010/08/standon-calling-150x150.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMFB//EACQQAAIBAgUEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECBQMEAAYRITESE0FhJVTR/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AKq5nkr2pdUFl5wJaa2xqsKFJO4oG2x1Y8b6FT4Pgg0vNuxZrvMzsx1LJWswrewO5xjeJaDiatNWqxdg7dR3a3Qng+sIbLkH1H4aN5+qn5gP/9k="},"createdAt":1587295082888,"updatedAt":1588443779975,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d14","old_image":"2010/08/standon-calling-150x150.jpg","categories":["festivals","music"]}
