{"id":"5e9c0c71774c2610387e53bf","artists":["5e9b69117a1236eccfeb2243"],"title":"Review: Lame Deer – Disguise EP","content":"<p>Self-described as “shoe-gaze guitars and post-punk vibes, mixed with a disco love for ghost house and electronica”, it’s fair to say that UK four piece <a href=\"https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/TheLameDeer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Lame Deer</strong></a> possess an eclectic range of influences. Signalling out two of my favourite artists as inspirations in the form of <strong>Joy Division</strong> and <strong>My Bloody Valentine</strong>, it would be all to easy for me to get on my high horse and be overtly critical, or even write them off as mere wannabes, yet in truth, <strong>Lame Deer</strong> have something rather special going on.</p>\n<p>On their newly released five track EP entitled <em><strong>Disguise</strong></em>, they tear through pioneered sounds of the aforementioned artists in visionary style, swinging from the sublime <em>The White Tiger</em> to the more reserved, thrillingly addictive <em>Cheap Hollywood</em>. Whilst the rest of the UK indie scene appear content with sidling nonchalantly down the middle of the road, <strong>Lame Deer</strong> deconstruct and rebuild their own sound with apparent ease.</p>\n<p>Almost impossible to pin down, the likes of <em>Cheap Hollywood</em> traverse the boundaries of <strong>Queens of the Stoneage</strong>-esque riffs and muddled shoegaze walls of sound. At the epicentre of <strong>Lame Deer</strong> is a stellar, no frills attached songwriting ability, whether it’s the<strong> Gorillaz</strong> vocals of <em>The White Tiger</em> or the emotional wreck of <em>Good Shoes. Cold Night</em>, the founding pillar is years of experience and a lack of inhibition.
