Soak it up.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/193782321&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"31058-new-raines-ghosts","category":"music","date":1425421803000,"wpid":31058,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587280367078,"updatedAt":1588441753220,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/609b1e880a7c53595beb2bcc4999779fb999c2fc.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
