{"id":"5e9c0311774c2610387e4a99","title":"News: Field Day 2014","content":"<p>It’s impressive really that, in the space a of a few short years, Field Day has gone from another date on the summer circuit, to one of the key “one day” festivals in the calendar.</p><p> Gone are the days where you were more likely to hear Tamsin discussing how much K she was on in the queue to the toilets than <a href=\"https://itsthenewthing.wordpress.com/tag/modeselektor/\">Modeselektor finishing their set</a>, replaced instead by an event that is finally starting to live up to the constantly <em>staggering </em>lineups they pull in. A feat that the organisers should be congratulated on.</p>\n<p>On that note, here’s who we already knew were playing:</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>Metronomy/ Danny Brown/ Dusky/ George Fitzgerald/ Innervisions: Dixon & Ame / James Holden/ Jessy Lanza/ John Wizards/ Jon Hopkins/ Omar Souleyman/ Oneohtrix Point Never/ Seun Kuti & Fela’s Egypt 80/ Sky Ferreira/ The Temper Trap/ Warpaint </b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">Which as far as the first confirmations go for a city festival, is not too shabby at all. <strong>Danny Brown, Metronomy, Jon Hopkins </strong>and <strong>Warpaint </strong>need no introduction. On the electronic side, <strong>Omar Souleyman, James Holden, George Fitzgerald and Oneohtrix Point Never </strong>are the big names that will pull in the RA crowd – whilst German label <strong>Innervisions </strong>founders Dixon and Ame look set to play some of the brilliance on their roster. Yr alt kids got <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>John Wizards </b>and <strong>Seun Kuti</strong><b> </b>(No-one’s world was set alight by the news <strong>The Temper Trap </strong>are still about).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">A great start, but it’s the latest announcement that has perked peoples’ ears up (a fact no doubt reflected in ticket sales over the past 24 hours):</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>All We Are/ Blood Orange/ Courtney Barnett/ Charlotte OC/ DJ Barely Legal/ </b><b>East India Youth/ Éclair FiFi/ Erol Alkan b2b Daniel Avery/ Evian Christ (DJ)/ </b><b>Fat White Family/ </b><b>Gerd Janson</b><b>/ Ghostpoet/</b><b> </b><b>Huw Stephens/ Jaakko Eino Kalevi/ Jackmaster & Oneman present Can U Dance/ Jagwar Ma/ Lunice/ Moxie/ Pawws/ Ryan Hemsworth/ SBTRKT/ Simian Mobile Disco (exclusive new live show)/ Slackk b2b Samename/ SOHN/ Sophie/ Teleman/ Tim Burgess (DJ)/ Todd Terje (live)/ Vessel</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">There are too many there to go in to proper detail for each, but let’s just say we’ll see you down front for <strong>Daniel Avery</strong>, <strong>Fat White Family</strong>,<strong> Evian Christ</strong>,<strong> Lunice</strong>,<strong> Sophie </strong>and<strong> Todd Terje.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">But the real news this year is the expansion of the festival from a one day event, to a two day weekender – I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that this will do some fairly brilliant things to the atmosphere, when you look at the difference that a lack-of-sleep-but-still-able-to-doze-in-an-actual-bed mindset has done to other city centre weekenders. All we knew previously was that Sunday would see <strong>Pixies </strong>headline, an interesting choice. Their recent material might have been a damp squib for some (read: me), but live reports have suggested they’ve lost little of their original ferocity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">But now we have the first few other acts who will be joining them. <strong>The Horrors </strong>hit the festival circuit again, off the back of their forthcoming fourth album. We’re yet to actually hear anything from it, but it’d be a huge surprise if it was anything short of excellent on the basis of <em>Primary Colours </em>and <em>Skying. </em>They’re joined by <strong>Temples </strong>(meh) and <strong>POND </strong>(aka Tame Impala’s incestuous brother).<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.ticketweb.co.uk/fieldday \">So, yeah, get buying tickets</a> – the festival this year looks worth even having to brave Ticketweb.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">Oh and I think the organisers are keen to promote their special <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/field-day-festival/field-day-radio-episode-19\">Field Day radio show</a>, which is presented by Eat Your Own Ears boss man Tom Baker. It’s not gonna change your life but, if that lineup has you a bit lost, it should give a taste of the quality on offer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\"><strong>Update, March: </strong>We’ve just got word that there are further additions to the lineup, including a healthier looking Sunday lineup. They are:</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">Saturday<br />\n</span><b>Arthur Beatrice/ Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks/ Bake/ Eyedress/ FunkinEven (live)/ Jamie Isaac/ Jamie xx/ Jen Long DJ/ Marc Riley DJ/ Neneh Cherry & RocketNumberNine/ Only Real/ Phil Taggart DJ/ ReviveHer/ Tourist</b></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">Sunday<br />\n</span><b>Drenge / Telegram / Childhood / The Bohicas / Shy Nature</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">Obvious standouts include Jamie XX; Avey Tare’s new project, Slasher Flicks; long time Crack in the Road favourite Jamie Isaac and Drenge.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">Tickets are still available and, now it’s getting warmer, aren’t you starting to pine enough for summer festivals that your wallet can take the hit?</p>\n","slug":"26305-news-field-day-2014","category":"festivals","date":1386332790000,"wpid":26305,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2048,"height":1360,"src":"2014/01/20130525-field-day-08-ph-cfaruolo.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAgIBBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBxFhEiEx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQECIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AkdzdxqF/V7le1o1J5EkKhjGR5Dvg/e8x554JHZ1q1FDHkDhvWMZNFcYjP//Z"},"createdAt":1587282705197,"updatedAt":1588403524080,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2014/01/20130525-field-day-08-ph-cfaruolo.jpg","categories":["festivals"]}
