He was never poor in the first place, but there was always the sense that his lyrics and flow were overshadowed by his beat-making skills. Both parts of ‘Sunday’s Best/Monday’s Worst’ are quality, but it is the latter part of the song, which begins around the two-minute mark, that’s the highlight. The soul samples seem to channel J Dilla and the track builds, gaining momentum as it progresses.</p>\n<p>Black Milk’s album is currently untitled, but is due to be released in the summer and you can hear ‘Sunday’s Best/Monday’s Worst’ below.<br />\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F83654696\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20425-new-black-milk-sundays-bestmondays-worst","category":"music","date":1363683947000,"wpid":20425,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283763677,"updatedAt":1588441768341,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/9c3037599c2a71ccef8e03c9e915d8387cf9dca6.jpg","categories":["music","news","new","newnews"]}
