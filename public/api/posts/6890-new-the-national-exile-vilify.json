Exile Vilify is set to soundtrack the Valve Software platform style game Portal 2, also released this week. It showcases a rawer sound than The National’s previous record, High Violet, led with a softly played piano, it’s as much Simon & Garfunkel as it is comparable to their previous work. The fusion of Berninger’s strained vocals perfectly collides with Portal’s atmospheric, otherworldly feel, to create a fantastic sensory experience.
