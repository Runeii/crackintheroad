Then, right on time, the verse drops into a snare-laden funky house bassline which pogos the song into life, creating an interesting contrast with Ghostpoet’s often slurred vocals. ‘<strong>Liiines</strong>‘ has also been given a rework by glitch-house daddy <strong>Lando Kal</strong>.</p>\n<p>‘<strong>Liiines</strong>‘ and its remixes are set for release on <strong>September 5th</strong> on <strong>Brownswood Recordings</strong>.
