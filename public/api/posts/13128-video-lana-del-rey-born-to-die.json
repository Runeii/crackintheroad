Also, this video isn’t recommended for those with an unhealthy crush upon <strong>Lana</strong> (myself), as it shows her getting rather intimate with the aforementioned tattooed guy. As a video, it’s pretty cliched, but hey, what else were we expecting from the new princess of pop?</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bag1gUxuU0g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>NB. 1) Is it just me or is Lana retardedly cross-eyed in the clip?</p>\n<p>2) Those tigers must have been heavily sedated.</p>\n","slug":"13128-video-lana-del-rey-born-to-die","category":"music","date":1323893157000,"wpid":13128,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293253559,"updatedAt":1588441784972,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/6e8dc460cfb6b89d7970302259febd0aa73b38c6.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
