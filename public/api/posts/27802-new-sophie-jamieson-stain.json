Undulating in a dynamic galvanized by a new found confidence, ‘Stain’ has an ethereal quality that maintains the listener’s attention in a manner similar to eager attention paid to a well versed story teller.</p>\n<p>Filled with impassioned instrumental nuances and a simply beautiful vocal line, ‘Stain’ is one of my favourite tracks of 2014.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142972378&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27802-new-sophie-jamieson-stain","category":"music","date":1396871597000,"wpid":27802,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282250283,"updatedAt":1588441759111,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/306f6d71552819574cc8be4e742d602a232cf3eb.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
