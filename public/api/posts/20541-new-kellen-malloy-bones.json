{"id":"5e9c0712774c2610387e4f34","artists":["5e9b690a7a1236eccfeb21ef"],"title":"New: Kellen Malloy – Bones","content":"<p>Having wowed with his duo of debut tracks,<em> Ocotillo</em> parts I & II, LA’s <strong>Kellen Malloy</strong> dropped this stunning number while SXSW was in progress, hence the tardiness of the post.</p><p> Atmospheric and brooding, <em>Bones</em> is far downbeat and sombre in both tone and content, with the barely audible vocals burrowing through the layered guitar lines. There’s hints of Deptford Goth alongside more minimal mid-00’s dubstep in the production. Sleek, elegant and showcasing the immense diversity and talent that Malloy possesses. Check out Bones below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F82855770\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20541-new-kellen-malloy-bones","category":"mpfree","date":1364335961000,"wpid":20541,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283730576,"updatedAt":1588441767939,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/43d5f120e5b5e5ee0c024bbf3e97de3fef97f2fc.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
