With the Blake-esque beat rumbling beneath the surface and elegant, ever-so-tender vocals hovering alluring over a refined piano section, it’s a stunning composition. The repeated lyric<em> “I try so hard, that it breaks my heart”</em>, will be echoing around your head for hours after several listens. Whilst I can find no information whatsoever on the duo, aside from the quote on their myspace page – “Miss t.erner is a sound-accoustic marriage between the Berlin based <strong>Mr. Terner</strong> and <strong>Miss T</strong> of Sweden”, I’m extremely excited to hear more. Check out <em>Starship</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2583322313/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://missterner.bandcamp.com/track/starship\">Starship by miss t.erner</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14544-new-miss-t-erner-starship","category":"introducing","date":1328192378000,"wpid":14544,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292956930,"updatedAt":1587825904166,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
