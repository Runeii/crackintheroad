A year on since their first full length release, and much critical acclaim from numerous music editorials such a NME and Q; <em>Say No To Love</em> continues in the same vein as much of their self titled debut. An impressively well crafted pop track, it is certain to propel them further into the public domain, with <strong>Kip Berman’s</strong> vocals hovering delicately over the surf pop and shoegaze influenced guitar riffs. However, one noticeable improvement is in the lyrics, far more storytelling than anything featured on their previous LP, and more emotionally hard hitting, recounting the story of a missing lover with “<em>hearts on your sleeve</em>“, whilst “<em>trying hard not to say, what you just don’t feel</em>“. <em>Say No To Love </em>will be released in an exclusive 7″ format, with b-side <em>Lost Saint</em>, which is another gem, reaffirming the band as a mouth watering prospect for the future.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thepainsofbeingpureatheart.com/\">Check Out The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart Official Site</a></p>\n","slug":"1488-review-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart-say-no-to-love","category":"music","date":1276979978000,"wpid":1488,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":333,"src":"2011/06/pains1.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMG/8QAHxAAAwACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQGIQUREkGR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgP/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ax3k+SU4zyVjqzSO7MLaDVn8lQsoIHtT39g9ZGnO/IXdq7J03vQlqMJN6LHsn9xjJTCUrB81o/9k="},"createdAt":1587295182444,"updatedAt":1588403566418,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/pains1.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
