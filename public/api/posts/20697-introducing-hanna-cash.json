Hanna Cash draw upon influences from yesteryear Manchester, though while it would be easy to draw the typical 80’s pop comparisons, this duo have added their own guilt edge to the sound that makes ‘Worst Birthday’ stand out from a great number of other reverb drenched bands.</p>\n<p>Hanna Cash will keep the warmth until summer, whenever that may arrive.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F83996147\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20697-introducing-hanna-cash","category":"introducing","date":1364647814000,"wpid":20697,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/03/tumblr_mkdn4mcnee1r821dno1_1364484695_cover.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQb/xAAiEAABAwMDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMRAAUhBBNBIiMxNVH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCdftG3Z0PKxqHCp1GQCWxMhQnBxMRz5obqpu8elsKuSy6SfvdND1GWBTs//9k="},"createdAt":1587283694262,"updatedAt":1588403531493,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2013/03/tumblr_mkdn4mcnee1r821dno1_1364484695_cover.jpg","categories":["introducing","newmpfree","mpfree","new","music","newnews"]}
