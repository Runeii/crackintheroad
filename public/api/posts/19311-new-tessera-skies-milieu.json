With production from Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason, it’s intricate layered beauty is matched with an air of intense simplicity and understated ambience. Not too far from the <strong>Guillemots</strong>, their sound is a more refined, classically-influenced approach than we’ve perhaps come to expect from Northern artists. One of those tracks that immediately makes far more sense when placed alongside the lyrics, it’s an extremely promising foot-forward from one of the North East’s brightest stars,<strong> Tessera Skies</strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76260593\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19311-new-tessera-skies-milieu","category":"music","date":1359077290000,"wpid":19311,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284097411,"updatedAt":1588441771394,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/0326a36ccc8e9fa7a10938f1ce16468648ba1f97.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
