Thankfully, her return track, <em>Storm In My Cup</em>, is devastatingly brilliant, and surprisingly far more upbeat. Although it’s arrival at the tail end of the year might be clouding my thinking, I’m fairly happy to go on record and say this is one of my favourite songs of 2014.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/179856227&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30333-new-little-deed-storm-cup","category":"music","date":1418167695000,"wpid":30333,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1600,"height":1132,"src":"2014/12/little-deed.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIhAAAQMDBAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEQYSITEiM1Fh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDM49+0GITaJOnHlyAgBSw4sAnaAT7O85PzJ6xxUibdNLOTH1xbVIbjqcUW0bz4pzwOVE9fppShb//Z"},"createdAt":1587281796230,"updatedAt":1588403513756,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/12/little-deed.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
