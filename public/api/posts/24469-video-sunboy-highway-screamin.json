Several minutes of stop motion footage of scribbling on a blackboard, as the scenery rotates around the lyrics to the song, it’s nothing short of absolute genius, and, well, I don’t want to spoil it for you… With their 90’s Brit-pop sound mixed with an added tinge of psychedelia and these stunning visuals, <strong>Sunboy</strong> are arguably the new band of the year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Z_OwMDf0S6M\" height=\"315\" width=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24469-video-sunboy-highway-screamin","category":"music","date":1380664836000,"wpid":24469,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282921182,"updatedAt":1588441761857,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/068e44dea61da8a6241c6d4b91102c6c8911e62d.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
