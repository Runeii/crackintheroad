There’s not quite the slickness nor the art rock vibe that <strong>Reed</strong> manages to instill, however <strong>Memory Fossils</strong> debut release entitled <strong><em>Brumous Boys</em></strong> is an accomplished collection of lo-fi gems. <em>On Anatomies At Night</em> is as twee and desirably honest sounding as anything <strong>Real Estate</strong> have ever written, never mind being insanely catchy.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2198580159/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Elsewhere on the release there’s the delightful drawl of <em>Albert Camus, What Do You Do When I’m Not Around?</em> and the fuzz drained hum of <em>Lou Reed’s Tiny Echoes</em>, sounding like a major label big budget artist attempting to record an album that sounds more modest than the financial backing would suggest.
