It’s all 60’s guitars, violin swoons and tinkling pianos, enough to win over even the most ardent <strong>Del Rey</strong> hater. Lyrically it’s stereotypical<strong> Lana</strong>, quoting Scarface and harking on about ‘bad boys’ and living fast/dying young, but hey, you know the score by now right?</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F46842205&show_artwork=true&oauth_token=1-16343-12721211-9694798aad8cfbe\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Kudos to <a href=\"https://disconaivete.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Disco Naivete</a> for the heads up.</p>\n","slug":"16567-new-lana-del-rey-never-let-me-go","category":"music","date":1337379743000,"wpid":16567,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587288062302,"updatedAt":1588441777931,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/6e8dc460cfb6b89d7970302259febd0aa73b38c6.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
