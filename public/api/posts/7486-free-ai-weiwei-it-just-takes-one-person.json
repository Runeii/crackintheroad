Alternatively, he could have just “disappeared”, after all it is easy to misplace an artist, funny how they only go missing in China though.</p>\n<p>It’s a depressing story, especially when you consider that western governments allow this shit to happen. Regardless, the worldwide art community’s reaction has been proactive and in some cases provocative.  Yesterday a friend of mine jumped the barrier at the Tate and ran openly over <strong>Weiwei’s </strong>installation, it was a provocative and inspiring statement. Three art students expressing their options openly, honestly and above all else peacefully; I take all my hats of to them. What was most inspiring was how many people eventually got involved. By the end the work was covered in people exploring the space, it was clear the aim was never to destroy, but more to express a single idea: It just takes one person.</p>\n<p><em>Next time you’re at the Tate make sure you do the same.</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dNQYo7REyBU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.avaaz.org/en/artists_for_ai_weiwei/?rc=fb\"><strong>Sign the petition.</strong></a></p>\n","slug":"7486-free-ai-weiwei-it-just-takes-one-person","category":"life","date":1304722726000,"wpid":7486,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587294413890,"updatedAt":1588441789354,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/05/ai+weiwei+chinese+artist+ai+weiwei+unveils+quzyhja2kkjl-292x50.jpg","categories":["life","arts"]}
