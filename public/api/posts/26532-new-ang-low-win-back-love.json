Remorse-fuelled R&B; it’s bold and delightfully intoxicating.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/133121299&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26532-new-ang-low-win-back-love","category":"music","date":1391603927000,"wpid":26532,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":640,"src":"2014/02/1891024_395589283910683_1479450106_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAHxABAAEEAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMAAgQRBkESExVx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgb/xAAdEQACAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAEYQMTFCGR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDM5eUSBGy5uaXyN7J6vG060WbFNL21Ocqz0H6CfsItKUjdsBQwc95MpuBWGoy7Y8xP/9k="},"createdAt":1587282462337,"updatedAt":1588403519842,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/02/1891024_395589283910683_1479450106_n.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
