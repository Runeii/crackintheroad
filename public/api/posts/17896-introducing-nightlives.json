With considered black and white imagery and slightly mysterious press photos, Nightlives have all the makings of a future internet sensation, following in the footsteps of the likes of <strong>The Neighbourhood</strong> and<strong> KO KO</strong> (now known as <strong>Pacific Air</strong>). Debut single<em> Underneath</em> is a twisted pop gem, fusing shoegaze influences with slicker electronic elements to master a swirling behemoth of a track that crescendo’s to a cacophony of reverb heavy guitars and midi drum samples, yet with an addictive undertone. It may be a relatively simple sound, but boy do they nail it. Check out <em>Underneath</em> below, and grab a free download from their <a href=\"https://nightlives.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>, as well as the first album teaser.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F58586971\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/48477028\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"213\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/48477028\">NIGHTLIVES – A Wink in the Face of Death – Teaser 1</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/nightlives\">Nightlives</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n","slug":"17896-introducing-nightlives","category":"introducing","date":1347477341000,"wpid":17896,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":720,"height":316,"src":"2012/09/296600_445639085478256_168440070_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAEAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIRABAAEDAgcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIABAUDIRESFiJRYZH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AybD2Wh0XlMlKBK4LjTtQQ5SKMlPfEN/FTDPd7Y/KUoP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587284706555,"updatedAt":1588403536539,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/09/296600_445639085478256_168440070_n.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
