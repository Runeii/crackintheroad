Taking Back Sunday were still incredible. Minus the Bear were the height of sophistication in rock music.

And now that the dust has long settled, it’s about time to go tomb raidin’. Turns out the man for the job is one Martin Ruffin, helmsman of twiddly, floaty, pop-punk three piece <strong>Souvenir</strong> (as well as one fifth of South Coast noise bastards <a title=\"Beaver. \" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thejcq#!/thejcq?sk=info\">The James Cleaver Quintet</a>, and the sole force behind the breathtaking <a title=\"Disco.\" href=\"https://www.myspace.com/quietinlieu\">In Lieu</a>), whose debut release <strong><em>Notes From Underground</em></strong> exhibits all of the virtues and none of the vices associated with their particular musical pathway. Songs like <em>Shades of Hades </em>and <em>Quiz Kid Donnie Smith</em> pump their figurative fists with all the energy and conviction of sweepy-haired adolescents, but temper their abandon with a healthy dose of tech born from experience and hard work. Likewise, closer <em>Troy </em>is possessed of a beauty and complexity wholly at odds with traditional preconceptions of punk rock.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=526986433/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>We all have our time in hell.
