A gorgeously enticing synth number from Japanese singer <strong>Cuushe</strong> titled I Dream About Silence marks her first new material in well over three years. Taken from <em><strong>girl / you know that I am here / but the dream</strong></em> EP, it’s a track that snuggles in somewhere betwen Bjork and Sigur Ros, with it’s ethereal nature and complexity of harmony. Check out <em>I Dreamt About Silence</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F49551184&show_artwork=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16967-new-cuushe-i-dreamt-about-silence","category":"music","date":1339705050000,"wpid":16967,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587285073369,"updatedAt":1588441776634,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/072eeca493cbf65e4a53631db353881e7655f53b.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
