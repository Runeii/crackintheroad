It is SO beautiful in London today.</p><p> I’m writing this at five in the afternoon and it still looks like midday. I’m picturing the summer in my head, the long evenings sitting in a park just after work drinking Pimms and eating peaches, because peaches will be in season again! Peaches can be IN the Pimms..</p>\n<p>I could go on, but instead let me draw your attention the real reason why summers on my mind, instead of whining on stereotypically about the weather and the goddamn Pimms.</p>\n<p>The French artist <strong>Laure Prouvost</strong> has just won the<strong> Max Mara Art Prize for Women</strong>, and her two part installation inspired by a residency in Italy, explores and transports to London the rich and sumptuous delights of this incredibly sensuous country. This exhibition is on at the <strong>Whitechapel Gallery</strong> till the 7<sup>th</sup> April, so catch it if you can during its last five days.</p>\n<p>If you didn’t have summer fever before seeing <strong><i>Swallow </i>(2013)</strong> you definitely will after having been seduced by this lushly shot film.</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/max-mara-art-prize-for-women-laure-prouvost\">HERE</a> to see the film and for more information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/04/laure20prouvost20harms.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-20736\" alt=\"laure20prouvost20harms\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/04/laure20prouvost20harms-260x183.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"183\" /></a></p>\n","slug":"20732-exhibition-laure-prouvost","category":"arts","date":1364918509000,"wpid":20732,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283681094,"updatedAt":1587825874749,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d17","categories":["arts"]}
