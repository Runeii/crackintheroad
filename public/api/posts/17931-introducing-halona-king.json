Now I’m not comparing New York soul singer<strong> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Halona-King/198736156826540\" target=\"_blank\">Halona King</a></strong> to Carly, but the essence of crafting a hit is very much the same, with King’s debut EP showcasing the perfection of the art.</p>\n<p>Opener <em>War Ground</em> is a stomping, raucous number; sassy and sensual, containing one of the  most addictive choruses of the year. Bringing 60’s Motown and 70’s soul into a modern perspective appears to be <strong>Halona’s</strong> aim, drawing from the ever-so sleazy yet seductive vibes that haunted much of the music from those era’s. This is the music that <strong>Amy Winehouse</strong> so desperately yearned to create. Piano ballad <em>Monster In The Night</em> brings the singer back down to earth, whist maintaining the pop sensibilities and luxurious production that makes it so enjoyable. <strong>Halona King</strong> may well be a new face on the block, but with an EP of this quality, it’s going to be hard to ignore her.
