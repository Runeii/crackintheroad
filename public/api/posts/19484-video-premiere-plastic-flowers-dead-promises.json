Greek duo <a href=\"https://plasticflowers.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Plastic Flowers</strong></a> are a true testament to this, having only been together for two years and already garned quite a following online, as well as the chance to play at this years SXSW Festival in Texas.</p>\n<p>With their fantastic new EP <em><strong>Aftermath</strong></em> released days ago (through <a href=\"https://store.manicpoprecords.com/products/507676-plastic-flowers-aftermath-ep\" target=\"_blank\">Manic Pop! Records</a>), featuring the beautiful CitR reviewed <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/18259-video-plastic-flowers-in-you-im-lost/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>In You I’m Lost</em></a>, the only way is up for this ‘self-desctructive pop’ group. We’re delighted to be able to bring you the first viewing of the visuals to accompany the EP’s lead track, <em>Dead Promises</em>, a twisted yet strangely well-rounded gem, drawing from early 00’s chart-busting pop and 90’s shoegaze. A video with a real organic feel to it, it’s a perfect reflection on the minimal, emotive and ever-so magical sounds of <strong>Plastic Flowers</strong>.
