With the swirling, introductory track<em> In Your Arms</em> leading into the gorgeous vocal led <em>Nothing To Fear</em>, it’s clear that these trio of tracks are a marked step-up from his previous work. Dreamy vocals and an undying sense of nostalgia dominate Nothing To Fear, sliding in somewhere between Wild Nothing and Washed Out, with a helping of Guillemots on the side.
