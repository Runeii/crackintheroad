There’s the lullaby swing of <em>The Future Is A Drag</em>, complete with lighters in the air chorus, ready made for festival circuits, coupled with the hazy, too cool for school chime of the Strokes-esque <em>Out 4 Daze</em>. I can already sense that I won’t be the last person to pen my thoughts on <strong>The Yum Dee Days</strong>. Check out The Future Is A Drag below, and if that floats your boat, then stream the full LP below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F96856826\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 559px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3317771320/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=false/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22511-introducing-the-yum-dee-days","category":"introducing","date":1371209333000,"wpid":22511,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283398162,"updatedAt":1587825870387,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
