It’s been starring at me, judging me; basically it fucking sucks. What doesn’t suck however is the record; 4 tracks of catchy as hell Beach Boys-infected psychedelic pop, that focus on great pop-song writing rather than sound-exploration, yet manage to succeed in both departments.</p>\n<p>In short, the record had ADHD, vocalists change without warning, glockenspiels fuck synths sonically and all with a haze like fuzz acting as some sort of a comfort blanket to the madness.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I kind of liked it.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3373372874/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15486-new-pandercakes-paint-by-numbers-ep","category":"music","date":1330987148000,"wpid":15486,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292708353,"updatedAt":1588441780470,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/03/pandercakes-u-165x132.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
