Stating one of my all time favourite records as a major influence, in the form of <strong>My Bloody Valentine’s</strong> <em><strong>Loveless</strong></em>; it’s slightly bemusing then that these two tracks bare very little, if any resemblance to the classic 1991 album. However that’s not to say <em>Build A Life</em> and<em> Ferrous Vessel</em> aren’t worthy of praise in their own right. ‘A Side’ <em>Build A Life</em> begins placidly before launching into a stomping three minutes of pulse-racing post-rock inspired indie; soaring guitars and crisp vocals included. The chorus, consisting of <em>‘Come on son, you don’t know what you’re missing, sex, death and repetition blues.’</em> proves distinctly memorable. Whereas <em>Ferrous Vessel</em> is a slower, more calculated track; siphoning off the intensity found on <em>Build A Life</em>, echoing<strong> Brand New</strong> at times. Light comparisons could be drawn to<strong> The Twilight Sad</strong> and <strong>Explosions in the Sky</strong>, yet the most obvious act to draw a likeness between are Oxford’s <strong>Spring Offensive</strong>. Check out both tracks below, which are released as free downloads from tomorrow.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2344548361/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://stspirit.bandcamp.com/album/build-a-life\">Build A Life by St. Spirit</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11521-new-st-spirit-build-a-life-ferrous-vessel","category":"mpfree","date":1316988061000,"wpid":11521,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":756,"height":1134,"src":"2011/09/291232_257124414328101_141288839244993_741242_1472592457_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAPAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgQF/8QAIxAAAQMEAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDIQAEERMFBhQiMTJCYf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAZEQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQISQVH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMFg8Sjjn2bdi4fvUr1hBt1JTB+SVZOfrPtIo34bavULVJBkGZoujti2OPcYtw42FEnbhO4oxjWVASAZ/RFSntDxJJuXsmYUQKLTgxyWn//Z"},"createdAt":1587293765125,"updatedAt":1588403546852,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/09/291232_257124414328101_141288839244993_741242_1472592457_o.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
