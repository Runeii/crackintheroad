Warm, stripped back, but distinctly <strong>White</strong>‘s style. You know what you’re getting with this one. I hope this will be a nice little album, possibly taking note of his friend <strong>Beck</strong>‘s more acoustic country stuff, but with strong blues and folk elements. We’ll have to wait and see about the full album, but for now, enjoy this…</p>\n<p><em>Hear Jack’s debut solo single, Love Interruption, below</em>. <em>Blunderbuss is due April 23rd on Third Man Records/XL Recordings</em>.</p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"https://widgets.beggarspromo.com/loveinterruption/widget.php\" style=\"margin: 0; padding: 0;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" data-audio-widget-jspf=\"https://widgets.beggarspromo.com/loveinterruption/widget.php?style=https://widgets.beggarspromo.com/loveinterruption/css/jspf\"></iframe></center></p>\n","slug":"14474-new-jack-white-love-interruption","category":"music","date":1327945808000,"wpid":14474,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":632,"src":"2012/01/jackwhite2-950x632.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIH/8QAIhAAAQMDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQRIQUGEhYxQUJh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABFR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDJNua1RVEAfqTpQ9kgitAD2LSeVycHH0YVdTw+kVdx8XqM2RFKRhy//9k="},"createdAt":1587292980019,"updatedAt":1588443775968,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2012/01/jackwhite2-950x632.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
