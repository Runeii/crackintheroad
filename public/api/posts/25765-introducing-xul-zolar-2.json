Forgoing their native Germanic tongue for a softly spoken neutral English tone means that their labour can be loved across borders.</p>\n<p>With very little material online, in fact, in over a year they’ve only made three tracks available digital, ‘Bedouin Man’ being the latest of these. It takes a more immediately infectious route than the slow invasion of your senses that made up their last single, but no less enveloping.</p>\n<p>Ich liebe Xul Zolar.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118675730″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"25765-introducing-xul-zolar-2","category":"music","date":1389043447000,"wpid":25765,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":532,"src":"2014/01/969255_593782740647002_341710965_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAfEAABBAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDEQUhBAYSI6H/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBv/EABwRAAEEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMRBBIhMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ah5DsI4HpeNuAcPG9WoUmbgD3Axxk2bJad/URG9x4L8VLPlSagWv/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282605425,"updatedAt":1588403522516,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d37","old_image":"2014/01/969255_593782740647002_341710965_n.jpg","categories":["music"]}
