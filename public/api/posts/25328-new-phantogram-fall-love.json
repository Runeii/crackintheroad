The single is what you’d expect from <a href=\"https://phantogrammusic.virb.com/\">Phantogram</a>: electronic elements working in unison with traditional instrumentals, pounding background synth rhythms, thoughtful depth of layers. The track begins with strings and gradually adds different elements to become an auditory wonder, which works in harmony with Barthel’s floating lyrics. If this track is any indication of what to expect next from <a href=\"https://phantogrammusic.virb.com/\">Phantogram</a>, <em>Voices, </em>set to drop February 18th in the new year, shouldn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W97JLBc7C8k?start=24&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25328-new-phantogram-fall-love","category":"new","date":1386680839000,"wpid":25328,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":658,"height":658,"src":"2013/12/4e359fcc.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAf/xAAjEAACAQMEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEESEABQYSEyIxUWGh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AI/xai40/GNnqJ4qmbcBUziupke6zooHiBF7rdyiXUZ7G/tqbyZkY9emT6fj60inlkippWikdG7R5ViDi5H6BozszuzOSzE3JJuSdB//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282694101,"updatedAt":1588403523854,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d2f","old_image":"2013/12/4e359fcc.jpg","categories":["new"]}
