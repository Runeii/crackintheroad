{"id":"5e9c1a0493301f07e652aeb7","artists":["5e9b694b7a1236eccfeb25ac"],"title":"Introducing: Sylvia","content":"<p>A tinkling<strong> Perfume Genius</strong>-esque piano, a tender, sombre female vocal and a haunting sense of despair.</p><p> Whilst Milan isn’t known for it’s thriving indie scene, in combining all of the aforementioned elements,<strong> Silvia Tofani</strong> aka<strong> Sylvia</strong> is going some way to changing that. On her debut EP <em><strong>Musica Da Camera</strong></em> she’s found remorseful, guilt-ridden and wallowing in lust, all backed by intimate, sparse keyboard sections and choppy beats. The likes of opener<em> Found Desert</em> and EP highlight <em>I’m Not Your Mom</em> see<strong> Sylvia</strong> slip effortlessly into her finest ballgown, pirouetting without any inhibitions. Check out the entire EP and grab a free download if it floats your boat.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2679475156/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/transparent=true/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16518-introducing-sylvia","category":"introducing","date":1337184080000,"wpid":16518,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587288580564,"updatedAt":1588441778159,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273fad404e2374aa88cb01bb9f4.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
