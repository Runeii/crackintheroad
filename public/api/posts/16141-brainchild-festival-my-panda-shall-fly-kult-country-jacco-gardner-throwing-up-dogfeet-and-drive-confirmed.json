We know that. You know that. Heck, <strong>Bob Dylan</strong> and <strong>Suede</strong> are playing on the same weekend at <strong>Hop Farm</strong>. You might be thinking to yourself, ‘pretty fucking stupid to mention a better line up at a different festival on the same weekend’. Well it’s not.</p>\n<p>In our opinion, here at <strong>Crack in The Road</strong>, every band we present to you below are worth more than them lot. Yes <strong>Bob Dylan</strong> and <strong>Suede</strong> are legends, but these talented musicians are pioneers in their own right. They are the past, the present and the future of music all rolled into one.</p>\n<p>It’s for that reason; we’re straying away from the usual ‘festival blog’ approach of writing blurbs for each artist. We’re not lazy. We’d just rather the artists, and their music, speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>They’re not scared to experiment, and aren’t controlled by money hungry management or labels. They’re talent, at it’s best, with the magical ability to manipulate and encourage your view of the world to flutter through their music. Fuck Metronomy, Jessie J and Kaiser Chiefs. We’d much rather it this way.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mypandashallfly?ref=ts\">MY PANDA SHALL FLY</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>‘MPSF was born out of a weekly book club that gathered downstairs in a church in West London.
