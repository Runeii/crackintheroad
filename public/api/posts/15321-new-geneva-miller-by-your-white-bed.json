Centered around a gently picked guitar and the soothing vocals of Miller, there are moments in the production on By Your White Bed that could be deemed slightly weak, yet not frequent enough to render the track unlistenable. All in all, it’s another very promising release, check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=391877313/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15321-new-geneva-miller-by-your-white-bed","category":"mpfree","date":1330258146000,"wpid":15321,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":123,"src":"2012/02/43435289-1-165x123.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHRAAAgIDAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAFBgQSkf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAZEQEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADETH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMc4rn4dlqth5Ekq36mOIutENVkj6MmpJoEdkeNwymiCxu8YwOvtbKF8xNgRKZ//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587292759481,"updatedAt":1588443775575,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/02/43435289-1-165x123.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
