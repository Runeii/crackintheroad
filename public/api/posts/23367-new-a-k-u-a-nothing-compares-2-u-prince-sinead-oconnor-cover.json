On this new track, a cover of <strong>Prince’s</strong> <em>Nothing Compares 2 U</em> (although most famously recorded by <strong>Sinéad O’Connor</strong>… before she went bat-shit crazy…). A notoriously difficult track to cover, <strong>A K U A</strong> more than does it justice, shining a modern, very current sound upon the single from 1990.
