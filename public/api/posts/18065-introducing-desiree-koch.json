{"id":"5e9c0a97774c2610387e5232","artists":["5e9b68e57a1236eccfeb1f92"],"title":"Introducing: Desiree Koch","content":"<p>With covers on her <a href=\"https://www.</p><p>youtube.com/desireek0ch\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube</a> channel ranging from the likes of <strong>Elliott Smith</strong> to <strong>Deadmau5</strong> to <strong>Lady GaGa</strong>, it’s clear that Pennsylvania based singer <strong>Desiree Koch</strong> has a broad spectrum of influences. Whilst the demand for female singer/songwriters is stretched rather thin at the present moment in time, the debut EP from Koch showcases vast potential, both in songwriting and marketability.</p>\n<p>Opening track <em>Tree Room</em> is part <strong>Laura Marling</strong>, part <strong>Eddi Front</strong>, with the gentle aroma of 60’s Americana wafting by. As a release, it documents juggling the turmoil of inner demons and outer complexities, most notably on the stunning <em>Reunion</em>, pleading with her lover for another chance. So the sound is far from complex, with the majority of the EP composed of a singular acoustic guitar and reverb heavy vocals, it’s intricacies are still there to hear, and all the more beautiful for it.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=727259056/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18065-introducing-desiree-koch","category":"introducing","date":1349947134000,"wpid":18065,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284631829,"updatedAt":1587825886550,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
