The story is simple but has the ability to be something all encompassing. We follow downtrodden no hoper Eddie Morra (<strong>Bradley Cooper</strong>) as he struggles through his daily existence as a failed writer. A chance meeting on the streets of New York causes his life to take a dramatic new turn, as he’s presented with a new designer drug NZT. This little clear pill has the ability to unlock the elusive 80% of the brain we never use; he goes from loser to stock market extraordinaire almost overnight.</p>\n<p>The concept has the potential to explore some interesting ideas; the subject of drugs on Wall Street and the consequence of drug use in general are at the very least presented to us. The problem is that the film always takes the easy option. Eddie progresses on Wall Street, gets his girlfriend back and progresses socially. It’s all a very standard depiction of success. The concept had the potential to give the piece so much scope. Unfortunately <strong>Burger </strong>doesn’t take it.</p>\n<p>There are times when the film comes close to achieving something. Eddies meeting with his ex-wife, who is trying desperately to come off the drug, is a poignant and in no way over bearing look at the reality of the situation. Unfortunately these moments are few and far between.</p>\n<p>Despite the film’s flaws it still manages to be vaguely entertaining. The film’s style in the opening 30 minutes is stylish and a valiant attempt at merging Hollywood sensibilities with more of kilter ideas. However, like the film as a whole, it simply lacks the scope and intelligence the concept demands.</p>\n","slug":"5820-film-review-limitless","category":"arts","date":1301244930000,"wpid":5820,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":465,"src":"2011/03/limitless_image_8723.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIG/8QAIBAAAQIGAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFBhESEyExB//EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAGxEAAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAgMSgcH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMxb31m40VZ+TkX0NpedbQVOp5NAlGg1BOAAO8Y9AiKle1SFRmhM0q3Jl8Or5HlyGFOKycqI29J7hCBipIXanG+H/9k="},"createdAt":1587294589641,"updatedAt":1588403558359,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/03/limitless_image_8723.jpg","categories":["arts"]}
