Having put out a <a href=\"https://samuelaaronbennett.bandcamp.com/album/compositions-scores\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp release</a> of compositions and scores back in 2010, these two tracks are his first foray under the <strong>Wales</strong> moniker. Considered, elegant and bewitchingly inviting, lead track <em>Go</em> is a blog-hit in waiting, whereas <em>Still Gone</em>, which featured on his previous release, is a more traditional acoustic number. Based on the strength of these tracks, perhaps it’s time for Bennett to focus on writing music for himself, as oppose to for films.
