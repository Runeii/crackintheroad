Flying Lotus – $200 TB","content":"<p>More new <strong>Thundercat</strong> with <strong>Flying Lotus</strong>, from yet another Japanese bonus disc exclusive.</p><p> Are these the new Blues Brothers or something? You can half-imagine these guys sat in outside a jazz café in the sun sipping on something strong and smoking something illegal, then just moseying on down to the back room and jamming out something laid-back and honest just like this.</p>\n<p>The subtlety of this track is blissful – all players riffing off each other, <strong>FlyLo</strong>‘s often bravado studio stylings held back for a very backseat affair. I can just imagine him reclining with that wide grin of his, letting <strong>Thundercat</strong> drive the track and <strong>Austin Peralta</strong> sitting shotgun. A lot of love coming from this track. Short but sweet. Looking forward to some more improv sessions stuff from the <strong>Brainfeeder</strong> camp.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to $200 TB below.</em></p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25996235\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25996235\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"11926-new-thundercat-ft-flying-lotus-200-tb","category":"music","date":1319151552000,"wpid":11926,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293675308,"updatedAt":1588441788039,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/eeb8b29fbdf6b259b70495ba52de0ee82a42e110.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
