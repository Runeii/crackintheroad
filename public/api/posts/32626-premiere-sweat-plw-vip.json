Six minutes of LCD Soundsystem meets Pulp-esque dancefloor ready pop, yet tinged with more sinister undertones, it’s ambitious, confident and thrillingly addictive. With a warehouse show at Rye Wax coming up on Sunday (21st August) and the promise of further material on the horizon, this more than marks them out as one of the UK’s most exciting new acts. Check out PLW VIP below.</p>\n<p>Like this? Follow our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02\" target=\"_blank\">On Repeat Playlist</a> for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/278569355%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-8Sto0&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"32626-premiere-sweat-plw-vip","category":"music","date":1471508336000,"wpid":32626,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587280035281,"updatedAt":1588442050933,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2016/08/13411693_840835276049749_7990803160445194521_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
