Even so, every little detail feels nicely measured – the guitar on <i>Sleep.Walk.In </i>is simple and unchanging<i> </i>but keeps the song moving perfectly all the way through.</p>\n<p>Given Trevor Powers’<b> </b>recent<b> </b>meteoric rise, comparisons with <a title=\"Youth Lagoon - Mute\" href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/19672-new-youth-lagoon-mute/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Youth Lagoon</b></a> feel somewhat unavoidable – by no means a bad thing. But with this seven track E.P. (available for free download on bandcamp – see below) Mazurkiewicz offers up a lovely and languid set of songs that are accomplished to the point of making any worries about familiar territory seem fairly irrelevant.<b> </b>It’s a less anxious collection than something like <b><i>The Year of Hibernation </i></b>or <b>Arrange’s </b><i><strong><a title=\"Arrange - Plantation on bandcamp\" href=\"https://arrange.bandcamp.com/album/plantation\" target=\"_blank\">Plantation</a></strong> ­</i>– Mazurkiewicz solution to worrying about things seems to be, according to his bandcamp, the fairly simple combination of the “Music I make, Blunts I Smoke.” It seems to work for him. <b></b></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1812591104/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://myhomealone.bandcamp.com/album/teddybears-weed\">Teddybears & Weed by Home Alone</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19930-introducing-home-alone","category":"introducing","date":1361372148000,"wpid":19930,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283926137,"updatedAt":1588441770092,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d1a","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2737185469e4d74ca3b082c5734.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
