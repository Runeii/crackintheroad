With a vocal subtly not too unlike <strong>Morrissey</strong> and an ear for a resoundingly anthemic guitar line, the Glaswegian troupe write with an emotional poignancy that elevates them well above their peers.</p>\n<p>Their upcoming free download debut AA single (out 16 April) <em>Ember / Blue</em> showcases two elegantly contrasting elements to the group, demonstrating versatility and maturity. Whilst it should be a given for all bands nowadays (sadly many ignore it), it’s also hugely encouraging to witness a band adapting to digitized times, with <strong>Father Sculptor</strong> having their <a href=\"https://www.fathersculptor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">own website</a> as well as a set of unique, quirky artworks. Of their two first outings, <em>Ember</em> comes across as the wise older brother, nostalgic and knowledgeable whilst <em>Blue</em> is the more courageous, heart-on-sleeve younger sibling, yearning to be let free from his leash.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3464258352/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16033-introducing-father-sculptor","category":"introducing","date":1334277484000,"wpid":16033,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292563044,"updatedAt":1588441779265,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27311f37df0419c89a6a0566d86.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
