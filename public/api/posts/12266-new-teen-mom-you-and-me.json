A three minute twee anthem in waiting, combining the charm of <strong>The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart</strong> with a faint, slightly gritty edge more commonly associated with the likes of<strong> Cloud Nothings</strong>. Plenty of warm fuzz, oozing with heartbreak and fantastically enjoyable, as they themselves put it ‘[Teen Mom are] just a band, playing love songs.’. Here’s hoping they have plenty more up their sleeves.
