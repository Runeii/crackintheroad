In short it seemed frivolous to post the track; it felt like something that would fall into all of your ears eventually. Well, as it turns out, you’ve no doubt all heard the track; the story behind this emerging female MC however is perhaps less known. Turns out Banks went to the same school as Nicki Minaj, <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.laguardiahs.org/about/history.html\" target=\"_blank\">Manhattan’s drama-friendly Fame school</a></strong></em>, and more importantly had zero permission to use Lazy Jay’s loops. Down came the video and the track became more difficult to find. This however, doesn’t negate from the tracks weight, not by a long shot. It manages to be gut wrenchingly feminine while gloriously upfront and boisterous. The lyrics attack with venom and wit,<strong><em> “I’ma ruin you kunt”</em></strong>, oh and Jay’s beat isn’t bad either. So, legal battles aside, here’s your single of the week.</p>\n<p><object id=\"4026984\" width=\"400\" height=\"24\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"soundFile=https://hulkshare.com/ap-07i1zbl8di4z.mp3&titles=Azealia Banks - 212.mp3&skin=sheep&dllink=https://www.hulkshare.com/07i1zbl8di4z\" /><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /><param name=\"menu\" value=\"false\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://on.hulkcdn.com/static/embed.swf\" /><embed id=\"4026984\" width=\"400\" height=\"24\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://on.hulkcdn.com/static/embed.swf\" FlashVars=\"soundFile=https://hulkshare.com/ap-07i1zbl8di4z.mp3&titles=Azealia Banks - 212.mp3&skin=sheep&dllink=https://www.hulkshare.com/07i1zbl8di4z\" quality=\"high\" menu=\"false\" wmode=\"transparent\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"12018-single-of-the-week-azealia-banks-212","category":"music","date":1319453033000,"wpid":12018,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293652948,"updatedAt":1588441787800,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/d08b993548a00a5a535e20c9c2aff7b6287dfb1e.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
