So, unravel your best pair of headphones, put the wrapping paper to one side, and brace yourself for the ultimate rundown of the best albums of 2011.</p>\n<p>#50 <strong>The Weeknd</strong> – <em><strong>House of Balloons</strong></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/theweeknd_houseofballoons/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13353\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13353\" style=\"margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;\" title=\"The Weeknd - House of Balloons\" src=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2011/12/TheWeeknd_HouseOfBalloons.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/TheWeeknd_HouseOfBalloons.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/TheWeeknd_HouseOfBalloons-165x165.jpg 165w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/TheWeeknd_HouseOfBalloons-260x260.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first of <strong>Abel Tesfaye’s </strong>three releases this year was also his strongest. Combining his unique slick, ever-so sleazy R’n’B style with immaculate production values, it’s no surprise that <strong>The Weeknd</strong> has since been recruited by the likes of <strong>Drake</strong>, <strong>Florence</strong> and <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>.

Grounded amongst hip-hop beats, the self-titled LP delves into 80’s pop and 70’s soul inspirations, forming his most accomplished release to date. JD</p>\n<p>#48 <strong>Laura Marling</strong> – <em><strong>A Creature I Don’t Know</strong></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/51aa6lyeiwl/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13361\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13361\" style=\"margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;\" title=\"Laura Marling - A Creature I Don't Know\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/51Aa6LYeiWL.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/51Aa6LYeiWL.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/51Aa6LYeiWL-165x165.jpg 165w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/51Aa6LYeiWL-260x260.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Having been nominated for the Mercury Prize with her two previous albums, <strong>Marling’s</strong> third attempt was her most eagerly anticipated to date. Showcasing her ever maturing songwriting skills and elegant vocals, <em><strong>A Creature I Don’t Know</strong></em> lurches between sedately soothing and volatile and passionate. JD</p>\n<p>#47 <strong>Slow Club</strong> – <em><strong>Paradise</strong></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/slowclubparadise/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13362\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13362\" style=\"margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;\" title=\"Slow Club - Paradise\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/SlowClubParadise.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/SlowClubParadise.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/SlowClubParadise-165x165.jpg 165w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/SlowClubParadise-260x260.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>In September, folk duo <strong>Slow Club</strong> released long awaited sophomore record <em><strong>Paradise</strong></em>, to widespread acclaim. Firmly attacking the twee labels attracted by debut <em><strong>Yeah So?</strong></em>, the album displays a maturity and bravery in its minimalism, whilst retaining the delicate vocal chemistry that has come to represent their unique appeal.

Not only is <em><strong>Wander/Wonder</strong></em> <strong>Alec Koone’s</strong> best record yet, it set him high above his ruddy moody contemporaries.

Flipping between bizarrely uplifting pop tracks and more soulful numbers,<em><strong> w h o  k i l l</strong></em> is the most enjoyable yet intimidating album of the year. JD</p>\n<p>#44 <strong>Young Montana?</strong> – <strong><em>Limerence</em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/limerence/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13364\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13364\" style=\"margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;\" title=\"Young Montana? - Limerence\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Limerence.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Limerence.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Limerence-165x165.jpg 165w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Limerence-260x260.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Jon Pritchard’s</strong> debut record<em> <strong>Limerence</strong></em> proves a vibrant combination of 90’s hip-hop and contemporary dance music. Remixing for and touring with <strong>WU LYF</strong> has deservedly brought his music to a larger audience. JD</p>\n<p>#43 <strong>EMA</strong> –<em><strong> Past Life Martyred Saints</strong></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/past-life-martyred-saints/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13366\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13366\" style=\"margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;\" title=\"EMA - Past Life Martyred Saints\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/past-life-martyred-saints.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/past-life-martyred-saints.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/past-life-martyred-saints-165x165.jpg 165w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/past-life-martyred-saints-260x260.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>With lead single <em>California</em> creating a stir on the internet due to it’s gritty, inescapable honesty, <strong>Erika M. Anderson’s</strong> debut solo LP again drew the plaudits. Past Life Martyred Saints combines the angst of a disillusioned twenty-something with the fragility that only real-life experience can harness. JD</p>\n<p>#42<strong> Peaking Lights</strong> – <strong><em>936</em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/peaking-lights-936-cover-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13381\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13381\" style=\"margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;\" title=\"Peaking Lights - 936\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Peaking-Lights-936-cover1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Peaking-Lights-936-cover1.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Peaking-Lights-936-cover1-165x165.jpg 165w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Peaking-Lights-936-cover1-260x260.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the surprise LP’s of the year,<em><strong> 936</strong></em> by<strong> Peaking Lights</strong> has popped up in numerous end of year lists, and quite rightly so. With a tip of the hat to the likes of <strong>The XX</strong> and<strong> Warpaint</strong>, <strong>Peaking Lights</strong> create an atmosphere entirely their own, with a record that’s as modest as it is extravagant. JD</p>\n<p>#41 <strong>Tyler, The Creator</strong> – <strong><em>GOBLIN</em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/tyler-the-creator-goblin/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13368\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13368\" style=\"margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;\" title=\"Tyler The Creator - Goblin\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Tyler-The-Creator-Goblin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Tyler-The-Creator-Goblin.jpg 500w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Tyler-The-Creator-Goblin-165x165.jpg 165w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2011/12/Tyler-The-Creator-Goblin-260x260.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p data-ft=\"{\"type\":1}\"><strong>Odd Future</strong> figurehead <strong>Tyler, The Creator</strong> released his major label debut <em><strong>GOBLIN</strong></em> in May, preceded by ambitious single <em>Yonkers</em>.
