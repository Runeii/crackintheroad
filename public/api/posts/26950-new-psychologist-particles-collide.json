A few years on, and Woods is stepping back out from the shadows, with the release of new track, <em>When Particles Collide</em>. Bolder, and a fuller sound than experienced on his EP, it’s a definite progression, and is perhaps most outwardly ‘pop’ orientated, yet without losing the glossy, glistening edge that characterised his earlier material. Stream When Particles Collide below, and keep an eye out for an full LP coming later this year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135506852&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26950-new-psychologist-particles-collide","category":"music","date":1393245149000,"wpid":26950,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1024,"height":1023,"src":"2014/02/1912508_801199633227582_1847291908_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQGB//EAB8QAAEEAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgURAwYEEjEyYf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDJNOza2yAnWzuIukRh7cJ5eQA6qoAeTdKc7t+JMexQg//Z"},"createdAt":1587282380291,"updatedAt":1588403518481,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/02/1912508_801199633227582_1847291908_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
