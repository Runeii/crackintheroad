Their music has been used on a variety of films since then and you can hear that suspense and atmosphere leaking throughout the track.</p>\n<p>‘You’re Always Good To Me’ blends sultry, dream-pop influenced vocals beside scattering drums and sweeping strings. The effect is almost hypnotic, the disparate influences coming together to form something otherworldly.</p>\n<p>OOFJ are releasing their second album <em>Acute Feast</em> next spring and you can listen to ‘You’re Always Good To Me’ below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/174604195&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30278-new-oofj-youre-always-good","category":"music","date":1416298489000,"wpid":30278,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":3392,"height":2328,"src":"2014/11/nov-12.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAIhAAAQIGAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFERIhFAYTMVFx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABf/EABoRAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDACECBBH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIaDUUSnU7bbqWxKNqlwoqbyKu4VAgejobjRTApPIdyprTisjdfLmE5G/mwOvkIQCdhnaMfanAm5/9k="},"createdAt":1587281803207,"updatedAt":1588403513919,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"2014/11/nov-12.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
