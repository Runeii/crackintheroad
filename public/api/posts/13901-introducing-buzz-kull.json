It’s sort of how I’d imagine the lovechild of <strong>The XX</strong> and <strong>The Horrors</strong> to sound, providing it had been starved of ever hearing a number one single.Their debut three tracks carve a very singular notch for the duo, building shallow, desolate caves in which they thrive. Whilst the vocals could perhaps do with slightly more production at times, the likes of<em> Fallen Flower</em> and<em> I Disappear</em> have limitless potential, that hopefully, will be fulfilled. Check out <em>Fallen Flower</em> below and hit up their <a href=\"https://buzzkull.bandcamp.com/track/i-disappear\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> for free downloads of their tree debut tracks.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33449733\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33449733\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/buzzkull/fallen-flower\">Fallen Flower</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/buzzkull\">Buzz Kull</a></span></p>\n","slug":"13901-introducing-buzz-kull","category":"introducing","date":1326734386000,"wpid":13901,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2012/01/334591_225021674245662_222043747876788_514997_1254488734_o-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQFBv/EACMQAAIBAgYCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAEDAgQFAAYRFCJBEjEyM2H/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBP/EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEVH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIVFky2sy466ivEA1i2tlt/LxiDrKAHsnCELbbDCJS5clacCVaEjrGerKh4sFGsOYIbifESOnwPWCUc57NHKX1x7/MBHpUj/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293082205,"updatedAt":1588443776464,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/01/334591_225021674245662_222043747876788_514997_1254488734_o-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
