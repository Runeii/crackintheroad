Driven by brooding bass lines and a steady percussion section, <em>(war paint)</em> comes across like a more funky almost tribal inspired <strong>Interpol</strong> whilst <em>(camera)</em> could easily pass for an early<strong> TV on the Radio</strong> single. Having played their premiere show in LA back in November, and with a EP expected later this month, I’m expecting big things from <strong>Bright Beast</strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"355\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 355px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2887538667/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://brightbeast.bandcamp.com/album/bright-beast-ep\">Bright Beast EP by Bright Beast</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15562-introducing-bright-beast","category":"introducing","date":1331233805000,"wpid":15562,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":162,"src":"2012/03/3189914342-1-165x162.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQGB//EACYQAAICAAQFBQEAAAAAAAAAAAEDAgQABQYREyEiQWESMTNRgZL/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAAgTR8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8APmmtWZJZku7liELb0urKucfpkSNzuAD+ffjEy6GjrDmPVqIV1skZxTKt6isHmIk9yPbfGDTv3AIEW7AJ5b8Q9gPOFBZft8zf7ODnHDdSoq5Z7U//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587292699131,"updatedAt":1588443775125,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/3189914342-1-165x162.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
