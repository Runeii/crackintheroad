More upbeat and memorable than the likes of <em>Bedroom Wall</em> or <em>Fall Over</em>, it’s a side to BANKS that personally I far prefer.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/159712413&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29223-new-banks-beggin-thread","category":"music","date":1405979801000,"wpid":29223,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1000,"height":800,"src":"2014/07/10294999_668739483163734_2732099804993973711_o-1000x800.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMI/8QAHxAAAgEEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRIQUTMUFx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQP/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM+W/GWp4Ge+e4AnSQIkIA2NZJPrzr4alGkHWuUTOBSlS0Y//9k="},"createdAt":1587282038110,"updatedAt":1588403516231,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/07/10294999_668739483163734_2732099804993973711_o-1000x800.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
