On this, his fifth original track, LA producer<strong> Kellen Malloy</strong> further shapes what is gradually becoming a stunning debut album. Drawing from drone and ambient works, alongside the <strong>Radiohead</strong> / <strong>Thom Yorke</strong> influences experienced on previous tracks, <em>Octillo III</em> is ambitious and at times beautifully uncompromising.
