The video is comprised of shots from the recent student protests in London, all captured by Fil Kaler, and makes for a poignant and fitting accompaniment. Dirt continues in a similar vein to previous Wu Lyf material; driven by a demanding drum beat, underpinned by a melancholic organ whilst the bizarrely delivered vocals rage viciously throughout the track. The lyrics self promote their upcoming full length release Go Tell Fire To The Mountain, ‘World Unite and I’ll Love You Forever’ being the key repeated phrase towards the latter section of the track. Whilst Wu Lyf aren’t quite revered as a cult on the same pretentious level as Odd Future, there’s certainly tinges of self obsession beginning to creep in to their music, however with music this good, can you blame them?</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-l5tM_Za1cE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"8194-new-wu-lyf-dirt","category":"music","date":1306368920000,"wpid":8194,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":641,"height":358,"src":"2011/05/screen-shot-2011-05-26-at-02.11.28.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAxUlEQVR4nAG6AEX/AESHjSJZXkRGRUGVnSZAQyIoKEGNlS4pKDxwdjmJkgAwXWI7YmY/QUE2bXJKVVUuOTpKio8iJiY0UlU4aW4AQXN3U25xHhkZNDAvO2luKFxgPTg4JiEhNlVYP3B1AJ24u1tlZi8pKWtmZnSZnSRPUgoICGJXVjBNUFGBhgCHvMFkh4o9cnZwm59bf4IfQENLfIBUjJAONjlRi5AAaZygbpGUZ4iMa4eKgq2wmsLGo8jLR3uAcpSXc6OoyZ9D5YM9YHkAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"createdAt":1587294351719,"updatedAt":1588403554959,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/05/screen-shot-2011-05-26-at-02.11.28.png","categories":["music","reviews"]}
