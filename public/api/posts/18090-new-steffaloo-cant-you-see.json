Still fantastic? Good, we can move on. <strong><em>In The Flowers</em></strong> will always have a special place in my heart, it erupts when I want it to erupt, it focuses exactly when I desire it to, but most importantly of all, it surprises me every single time I listen to it. Very few tracks can do this while still taking you on a journey that’s in any way tangible. It also takes me back to a time when, for want of a better word, I was really fucking sad. It reminds me of blinding pain, and yet, it also reminds of an eventual smile after sitting silent in a party for 3 hours. Songs like this don’t inspire you to think ‘everything’s going to be ok’, they inspire you to think ‘everything IS ok’.</p>\n<p>Steffaloo: everything is ok.</p>\n<p><em>Would You Stay</em> comes out October 23rd via <a href=\"https://www.mushrecords.com/release/MH285.php\">Mush Records</a>.</p>\n<p><object width=\"522\" height=\"300\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://yourlisten.com/Player.swf?id=16920713\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"522\" height=\"300\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://yourlisten.com/Player.swf?id=16920713\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object></p>\n","slug":"18090-new-steffaloo-cant-you-see","category":"music","date":1350412297000,"wpid":18090,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":109,"src":"2012/10/steffaloo-165x109.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAHxAAAgICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBAAhMQUGM2Gh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAeEQABAwQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAAECBBESIjFBkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A2Uzt2u5qz0XSvpdZMg1ER5mS2CdcRH0+suhy5AES0d8Yxg55Alr3fnxW0snIPJ1//9k="},"createdAt":1587284617638,"updatedAt":1588443772051,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/10/steffaloo-165x109.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
