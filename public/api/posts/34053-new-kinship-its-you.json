We’re talking those post 3AM vibes, somewhere between the party and the comedown. Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait too long to hear more from these guys. Check it out below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/352780037&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"34053-new-kinship-its-you","category":"music","date":1511275497000,"wpid":34053,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1365,"height":1365,"src":"2017/11/23213166_1742760022422526_2697917923014091085_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwYI/8QAJhAAAgIABQEJAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhEhEwcUIjFRUmGB0f/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/8QAGBEBAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIUH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ALbPtbahk7RNP1Mgv1LGTTxpLOFKCMoGPULSN5cbbAfWGbpNJ443VkblWB3BHrjGmj7EyUK6pNIq93h4DEDhpPwYUMgv3BkWWgWrAArR8dQ+0fOA9omNX//Z"},"createdAt":1587279782395,"updatedAt":1588403497964,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/11/23213166_1742760022422526_2697917923014091085_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
