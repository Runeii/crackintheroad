You don’t have a home, you should have known.</p><p></em>” quite a forcefully miserable way for Brooklyn’s <strong>Daytona</strong> to announce themselves yet utterly fantastic. Their debut track <em>Storm So Long</em> is the dictionary definition of ‘a grower’, with what on first listen appears clumsy, gradually solidifying into a stunning lo-fi anthem. As pointed out previously, it’s lyrically downbeat, but as <em>Storm So Long</em> rumbles by, it’s nigh on impossible to not be intrigued. With no other sign of the group anywhere within the murky realms of the internet, this debut track will have to satisfy my Sunday melancholic listening cravings for now.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2926266036/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://daytonapals.bandcamp.com/track/storm-so-long\">Storm so Long by Daytona</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12517-new-daytona-storm-so-long","category":"introducing","date":1321207100000,"wpid":12517,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293485298,"updatedAt":1588441786543,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2736a563c6f3f93c70758fdf83c.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
