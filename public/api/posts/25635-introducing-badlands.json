But no, no, no, no, no. This may be indebted to a thousand pasts, but those pasts are not the Brucey that our fathers and uncles love, the easy anthems that provide brief escape from a hatchback between a new build and a retail park. People forget that <b><i>Born in the U.S.A.</i></b><i> </i>wasn’t born from simple love of country, that the album’s first side ends with <i>I’m On Fire. </i>Nor is this the kitsch, the <a title=\"Don't get me wrong...\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_bQiIZXC9I\">sailor tats</a> and leather jackets of any two-bit greaser-throwback act.
