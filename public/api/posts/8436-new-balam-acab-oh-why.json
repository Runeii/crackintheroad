He literally came out of nowhere and cemented the producer as a firm ‘one to watch’ of the year of 2011. The first release from his full-length debut, <em>Wander / Wonder</em>, is an emotionally confusing and sonically stimulating piece of music. It has a rather off-kilter ability to comfort through the slow and thoughtful tones of a female singer, while terrifying through the screeches and howls of a child. An introducing introduction to the album. <em>Wander / Wonder</em> will be released on August 29.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F16690684\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F16690684\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records/balam-acab-oh-why\">BALAM ACAB – Oh, Why</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records\">TriAngleRecords</a></span></p>\n","slug":"8436-new-balam-acab-oh-why","category":"music","date":1307649563000,"wpid":8436,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/06/balamacabfront-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQI/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEQIFMZL/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/8QAHREAAQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAzEyQXHB8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AzTCbWsnU+rC/RCAK6SdcKHU/OkP/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587294303662,"updatedAt":1588443777746,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/06/balamacabfront-292x50.jpg","categories":["music"]}
