With their debut album now almost two years in the making, they’ve finally set a release date of 18 June for the eight track release entitled<em><strong> Plastic Soul</strong></em>. This new cut and title track from the record is a wonderfully languid pop number, bewitchingly befitting to today’s glorious weather.<strong> Leisure</strong> wear their 60’s inspirations on their sleeves, whilst the vocals of lead singer <strong>Jed Rouhana</strong> have a to-die-for charisma not too dissimilar to<strong> Pulp</strong> frontman <strong>Jarvis Cocker</strong>.
