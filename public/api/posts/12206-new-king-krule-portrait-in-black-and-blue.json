Combining the gritty, from-the-streets sound of <strong>Jamie T</strong> with the nostalgic story telling element found in <strong>Mike Skinner’s</strong> work, it’s not hard to see why the likes of <strong>Jay Electronica</strong> have supported him in recent months.</p>\n<p>New track <em>Portrait In Black And Blue</em> will feature on his upcoming EP, and as with previous work, is largely vocal driven, with an almost clumsily played guitar providing an endearingly shambolic foundation. There’s even shimmers of <strong>Scott Walker</strong> nervously peeking out from the track, with the stripped back to the bone feel, and crooner inspired vocal sections.
