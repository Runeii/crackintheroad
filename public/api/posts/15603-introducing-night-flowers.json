Drafting in friends and relatives for their debut EP <em><strong>Beginnings</strong></em>, they create a sound that is both refreshingly varied and instantaneously enjoyable. Opener<em> Neverlands</em> is a shoegaze inspired number, with touches of <strong>Ride</strong> and <strong>Slowdive</strong> amongst the acoustic guitars and reverb laden vocals. Whilst it’s clear that<strong> Night Flowers</strong> are far from the finished product, this collection of tracks if one of the most accomplished debut outings I’ve heard in a long time, with the stunning <em>Dials</em> standing out as a particular highlight.</p>\n<p>Modest and refined, the repeated refrain <em>“I don’t sleep well anymore</em>” is delivered with immaculate and considered resplendence, elevating the track beyond the realms of being simply another lo-fi meets shoegaze revival affair. Check out the video for <em>Dials</em> below, directed by <strong>Ryan Haysom</strong>, and grab the full EP underneath that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/38257295?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"170\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/38257295\">Night Flowers “DIALS” official music video</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/nightflowers\">Night Flowers</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 355px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3581559295/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"355\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15603-introducing-night-flowers","category":"introducing","date":1331425732000,"wpid":15603,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292682539,"updatedAt":1588441780284,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/068a69253e3bc4ee484fe3e85bab5e47ba3dd230.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music","videos"]}
