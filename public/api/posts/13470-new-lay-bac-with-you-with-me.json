The vocal samples are never more than a matter of milliseconds and the pitch-bending comes in somewhere between 8-bit and <strong>Dilla</strong>. Fucking fantastic.</p>\n<p>Check out<em> With You, With Me</em> below, and watch out for <em><strong>Short Cuts</strong></em> released through <em>ZOOM LENS</em> later this month.</p>\n<p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F32326816\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F32326816\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tomcruisin/with-you-with-me\">WITH YOU, WITH ME</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tomcruisin\">LAY BAC</a></span></p>\n","slug":"13470-new-lay-bac-with-you-with-me","category":"music","date":1325700679000,"wpid":13470,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293157165,"updatedAt":1588441784675,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b2737b8d843d0195dc170b12574f.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
