With a suspended <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thesoundoffalks\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> account, and a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thesoundoffalks\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> profile with only two likes (presumably the two girls that make up<strong> FALKS</strong>); information is perhaps purposefully scarce. The three tracks online so far, taken from a release (quite possible an EP) titled <strong>I Got Cold</strong>, showcases a fragile yet exquisitely self-assured side to the duo. Take the opening track <em>I Feel Nothing / At Night Part I & II</em>, an introspective, tearful ballad, blending elements of CitR favourite Eddi Front with the raw, early demos of Laura Marling. Blending what I assume are film/TV samples with their own music, in a manner that would make Conor Oberst proud, before slipping gracefully into the line, ‘<em>at night when I see the moon, I know it’s the same one you see too’</em>.</p>\n<p>Check out the beautiful video for <em>Ira</em> below, and the full EP underneath that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ylxHZS7ZKw\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1429388653/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=0687f5/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22447-introducing-falks","category":"introducing","date":1371054347000,"wpid":22447,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283412912,"updatedAt":1588441765689,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/b874bd8539df7d21ad231c3b1c821748da7db954.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
