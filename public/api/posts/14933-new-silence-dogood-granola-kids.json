{"id":"5e9c2ab99b6559241525d4bc","artists":["5e9b69447a1236eccfeb251d"],"title":"New: Silence Dogood – Granola Kids","content":"<p>Lo-fi appears to be all the rage at the moment, and Michigan’s <strong>Silence Dogood</strong> appear very much like they’ve been brought up solely on a diet of <em><strong>Slanted And Enchanted</strong></em> and 90’s Americana, nothing wrong with that though.</p><p> Their debut track <em>Granola Kids</em> sounds like it’s been recorded on a toaster; fuzzy vocals, deliriously imperfect guitars and a huge serving of genuine teenage angst/humour. In fact, <em>Granola Kids</em> may not seem it from the off, but it’s lyrically inspired – <em>“Neon girls who don’t react, sign electronic suicide pacts”</em> and my personal favourite, <em>“What’s my Muslim name today? I invent religious holidays. We resurrected Kurt Cobain, housebreaking all his dusty cliches”</em>. Sublime.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=441155099/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://silencedonegood.bandcamp.com/track/granola-kids\">Granola Kids by Silence Dogood</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14933-new-silence-dogood-granola-kids","category":"mpfree","date":1329139532000,"wpid":14933,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292857331,"updatedAt":1588441781872,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/7ee4188234f22848a18d7d7161daad40080237b6.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
