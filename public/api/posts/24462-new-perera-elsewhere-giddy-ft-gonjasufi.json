Since then the London via Berlin producer/songwriter has been quietly prepping for the albums’ no doubt modest release.</p>\n<p><em>Giddy</em>, the new release featuring the now infamous LA artist <strong>Gonjasufi</strong>, displays the records’ potential, but also its’ deserving of <i>far </i>more attention than its getting. In essence, <em>Giddy</em> acts as a duet, yet through its sparse production traits manages to explore 2 frames of consciousness that seem tragically incompatible.</p>\n<p><strong>Perera Elsewhere</strong> adamantly explaims “I’m gonna find you in your blinders”, while Gonjasufi “when they ask for me, tell them I’ve been here/I’ll be there”. It finds poetry in a potential union, rather than a successful one.</p>\n<p>At times, absolutely spell binding.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F113250769\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24462-new-perera-elsewhere-giddy-ft-gonjasufi","category":"music","date":1380626214000,"wpid":24462,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282923323,"updatedAt":1588441761885,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/f0e081aa5979336cd2d104b259183b66316a3cc2.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
