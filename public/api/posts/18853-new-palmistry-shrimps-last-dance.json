After that, the boy dropped off the face of the earth. Like completely, leaving me a bit scared that he’d stopped making music. It’s a mixture of happiness and relief then that I present his new EP, <em>Shrimps Last Dance</em>, a remarkably more stripped affair in compression to his earlier work. Here, the focus is almost exclusively on jams. There’s a heart-breaking undertone to it all too, the whole thing seems thrown together, chucked out and premature. But it’s these elements that are the records greatest strength: it feels like a compulsion rather than a decision.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3091711\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18853-new-palmistry-shrimps-last-dance","category":"music","date":1356611067000,"wpid":18853,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":534,"src":"2012/12/palmistry.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAQMEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBQAEESEHEhQi/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIbjvkaKiESbjEdfqZ8pZ8ZfHnwU9SeuNHSt7P0QazN2ct3HVrFihIUScA6GaUoP/9k="},"createdAt":1587284295059,"updatedAt":1588403534273,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/12/palmistry.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
