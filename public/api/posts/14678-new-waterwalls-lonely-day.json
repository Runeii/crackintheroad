So it’s very much <strong>Neon Indian</strong> meets <strong>Washed Out</strong>, yet it’s arguably better than half the tracks on either of the respective albums released by those two artists last year.</p><p> Synth heavy and vocals burdened with reverb, <em>Lonely Day</em> isn’t carving out new genres, and it’s certainly not going to spawn a host of copycat artists, however simply put, it doesn’t need to. Check out<em> Lonely Day</em> below, and grab a free download if you want.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1903268031/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://waterwalls.bandcamp.com/track/lonely-day\">Lonely Day by Waterwalls</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14678-new-waterwalls-lonely-day","category":"mpfree","date":1328635239000,"wpid":14678,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292924626,"updatedAt":1588441782565,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273fa9b93e687473c7277a324a5.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
