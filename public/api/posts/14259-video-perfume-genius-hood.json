The video is a statement of sorts, questioning the moral compass of society when it comes to same sex relationships, showing <strong>Hadreas</strong> in ‘romantic’ positions with another male (gay port star <strong>Arpad Miklos</strong>). As he himself excellently summarized in a recent interview with <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/45133-video-perfume-genius-hood/\" target=\"_blank\">Pitchfork</a>, <em>“If I just got my boyfriend to be in there with me, people could just pass it off as cute because we’re both boyish. I like the idea of not having things be so obvious.” </em>In an age when it appears that almost anything goes with regards to heterosexual music videos (see <strong>Rihanna’s</strong> x-rated romps), it’s refreshing to witness an artist challenging these out-dated traditions. Check out the video for <em>Hood</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOpkr8uNWpk\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14259-video-perfume-genius-hood","category":"music","date":1326896418000,"wpid":14259,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293056088,"updatedAt":1588441783529,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/97af28b2e0f12458d15fa7417ccfad4fe128704b.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
