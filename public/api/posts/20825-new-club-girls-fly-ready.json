Drawing the respectable elements of Little Boots’ slick, electro-pop and the adorable chaos found amidst the likes of Mozart’s Sister and Grimes, Club Girls has ambition, talent and ingenuity in abundance. Check out Fly Ready below, the B-side to her recent single <a href=\"https://clubgirls.bandcamp.com/album/i-can-do-a-lot\" target=\"_blank\">I Can Do A Lot</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2488679198/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20825-new-club-girls-fly-ready","category":"music","date":1365200057000,"wpid":20825,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283657092,"updatedAt":1588441767286,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/9062d3d48eb63054e3ea7217eabbb47d91d4b947.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
