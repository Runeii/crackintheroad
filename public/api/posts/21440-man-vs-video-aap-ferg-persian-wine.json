To begin with, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIigWhNt4sI#t=0m23s\" target=\"_blank\">@00:23</a> we see a shirtless gentleman waving around an AK-47, which cannot adhere to any of the recommendations laid out by responsible gun-user associations. The whole thing just screams “blown-off nipple” to me.</p>\n<p>If that wasn’t bad enough, a guy then climbs/walks on a ladder <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIigWhNt4sI#t=0m37s\" target=\"_blank\">@00:37</a> with no safety equipment visible whatsoever. It’s a good job that A$AP Ferg & Co. decide to kidnap the man, otherwise who knows what damage he would’ve done to himself wandering around that abandoned building? I hope that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIigWhNt4sI#t=0m57s\" target=\"_blank\">@00:57</a> they’re praying for him to gain a bit more common sense; danger awareness is an important attribute for adults.</p>\n<p>Something that the video re-roused in my mind is bewilderment over grillz. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIigWhNt4sI#t=1m07s\" target=\"_blank\">@01:07</a> we get a close-up of Ferg’s shiny, shiny teeth, which, as $$$WAG as they look, just make me think about how you go about your day-to-day business with metallic dentures. Do you have to take them out to eat? Do they need polishing every night? Do they make your mouth taste weird? The more I think about it, the more it appears to be a sure-fire way to get a huge dentist bill.</p>\n<p>Making the ‘Persian Wine’ video even more perplexing, a kid with grillz turns up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIigWhNt4sI#t=2m32s\" target=\"_blank\">halfway through the piece</a>. If I wasn’t already confused enough about their role, this child muddied the waters further. What’s going to happen as he grows up? I suppose they could be handed down to other younglings, but surely they have to molded to a person’s dentures, making the whole thing a financial car crash.</p>\n<p>So, in summary, I need a goddamn pair of grillz as soon as humanly possible.</p>\n","slug":"21440-man-vs-video-aap-ferg-persian-wine","category":"music","date":1367666800000,"wpid":21440,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1280,"height":800,"src":"2013/05/ferg-1280x800.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAHxAAAQMFAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDBAAFERIhIjEy/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgP/xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIiEf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AzK9GxHkWkgbMmocfB+epEKKiIie8dLNUNzbjIAXknOCjiIeuocz3HzSlCpkZfukn/9k="},"createdAt":1587283533880,"updatedAt":1588403530186,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"2013/05/ferg-1280x800.jpg","categories":["music","newreviews","new","newnews","opinion","videos"]}
