Uma is lifted from Panama Wedding’s debut EP, Parallel Play, out now.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/151911241&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"28683-new-panama-wedding-uma","category":"music","date":1401888856000,"wpid":28683,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":300,"height":116,"src":"2014/06/1526494_570355419718683_16593872_n-300x116.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAEAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIG/8QAHBAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQREiFB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABv/EABkRAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAwIhMv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A0mPs8dnyXdY6WugbYViOwIiOqdAKTaw0f//Z"},"createdAt":1587282107969,"updatedAt":1588403516611,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/06/1526494_570355419718683_16593872_n-300x116.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
