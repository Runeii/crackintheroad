Today we got it, the first cut from the debut album, due to drop Via <strong>Brainfeeder</strong> in March. It’s a squelchy little number, every sound is think and fuzzy, allowing textures to sink in, drift off and run away with you. Excitement is brewing for the album.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74387042\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19058-new-lapalux-guuurl","category":"music","date":1357848746000,"wpid":19058,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":610,"height":343,"src":"2013/01/lapalux-debut.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAhEAABAwQBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEABESISIFEyMyUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAGREBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAyEx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCHLnCJdYSW+nvR0BcRni3coNsQTrYuTc1Pyjv+Xse/LZ+7pSp+Q0MVRXs//9k="},"createdAt":1587284201447,"updatedAt":1588403533491,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/01/lapalux-debut.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
