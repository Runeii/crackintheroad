Check out standout tracks ‘On This Spot’ and ‘Stuck’ for some ice-cold calm as the nights draw in.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/109705857″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"25266-introducing-machines","category":"introducing","date":1386541430000,"wpid":25266,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":495,"src":"2013/12/155850_382878518469211_1950582727_n-950x495.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEI/8QAFxABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARYf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDKomJg9pJB/9k="},"createdAt":1587282699524,"updatedAt":1588443765670,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3e","old_image":"2013/12/155850_382878518469211_1950582727_n-950x495.jpg","categories":["introducing"]}
