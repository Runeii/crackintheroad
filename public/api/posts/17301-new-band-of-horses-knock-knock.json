With a fourth album titled <strong><em>Mirage Rock</em></strong> out later in the year via Brown/Columbia, the five piece have unleashed<em> Knock Knock</em>, the upbeat first track to be taken from the aforementioned LP. In typical <strong>Band of Horses</strong> style, it’s the sound of the deep south, almost feeling like it should have fitted somewhere on the Dukes of Hazard soundtrack.
