{"id":"5e9c0310774c2610387e4a96","artists":["5e9b68f27a1236eccfeb204d"],"title":"Introducing: Female Band","content":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There’s not a huge amount to be said about <strong>Female Band</strong> because there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of information on her, yet as all good music, her creativity speaks for itself.</p><p> What I was able to glean is that her name is Anna Vtorova and she released her two track EP on Mancunian label Haus of Pins back in mid-September. The name of the EP is Jacksonville and consists of two tracks, <em>He Takes Her On The Dance Floor</em> and <em>Jacksonville. </em>Both show an incredible talent despite their seemingly simple repetitive nature, especially on <em>Jacksonville</em>, this dark menacing chord vibrates through you as her distorted voice seeps through the lo-fi fog. On <em>He Takes Her On The Dance Floor</em> it’s almost impossible to hear her soft-spoken voice through the completely distorted and glitchy bass manipulation. According to the <a href=\"https://www.tyci.org.uk/wordpress/haus-of-pins-presents-female-band/\" target=\"_blank\">only interview I could find with her</a>, she draws a lot of influence from trip-hop and bass artists, such as Massive Attack, Portishead, Raime, Alva Noto and more. This is her 2nd EP, having released her first on Italian Beach Babe Records entitled <i>Good Bye New York, Forever</i>. With 2014 fast approaching, it’ll be fascinating to witness what she comes up with in the new year, especially with such a diverse and innovative sound. Give a listen to both EPs below:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/10145502″ params=”color=ff8d14&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1317332″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/12/FB1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25234 aligncenter\" alt=\"Female Band 1\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/12/FB1-260x418.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"418\" /></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"25231-introducing-female-band","category":"introducing","date":1386526080000,"wpid":25231,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":647,"height":467,"src":"2013/12/fb3.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBAUDEQYhEpGi/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgP/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCG4naVUe2djw4ZUdxcWv8AFwPre9bK1kWkNoAFhJAHQBwdj6RFK7e5kCb/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282704634,"updatedAt":1588403524055,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d1b","old_image":"2013/12/fb3.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
