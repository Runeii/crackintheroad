With a large proportion of exclusive charity releases, the tracks are rushed and dwell far too much upon attempted relevance with the benefitting cause. This isn’t the case with One At A Time, a track that bares no connection whatsoever with events in Japan, but doesn’t intend or need to, and serves as an excellent incentive to donate to the cause. Opening with looped samples of what appears to be children playing, the vocals float seamlessly over the top before the track breaks into a melodic refrain. Ambient influences, along with sparse touches of folk, effiortlessly merging with the funk inspired bassline makes One At A Time an intriguing and captivating listen.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=456085104/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://noahwall.com/track/one-at-a-time\">ONE AT A TIME by NOAH WALL</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"6574-new-noah-wall-one-at-a-time","category":"music","date":1302883236000,"wpid":6574,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/04/1746610633-1-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHBABAQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwUhBhFh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAX/xAAZEQABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAQygbH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMq8huq4LgYqqZnXEgvQJ2HxyR3KbrBQKfQYxhnE6GBWnE6GL//Z"},"createdAt":1587294511378,"updatedAt":1588443778709,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/04/1746610633-1-292x50.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
