Focusing on the tumultuous, traumatic relationship between Grace and Rich, in truth it was a rather weak episode, lacking any direction or solid storyline. Anyway, I’m not here to analyze the script; here’s my opinion on the music used in this weeks episode, and the chance to stream all the tracks in one place.</p>\n<p>First band practice – <strong>Fuck Norris</strong> – <em>Filthy Woman</em></p>\n<p>Awful band name, and fairly awful song, yet it did the job for opening the episode. Almost impossible to avoid touching upon cliches when inserting a band into a TV drama; at least they didn’t ask The Vaccines to play.</p>\n<p>Rich gets into the hospital – <strong>Kankouran</strong> – <em>It’s Alright Follow</em></p>\n<p>Surf-pop track released earlier this year, in a similar vein to The Drums. Good find.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3633846962/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Rich and Grace ‘have sex’ – <strong>Broken Clock</strong> – <em>Challenge</em></p>\n<p>Slightly too dance-y for what could have been a fairly emotional scene, yet events later in the episode put the scene in context.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9sAiyz7_JE\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Rich on his bike –<strong> Beirut</strong> –<em> East Harlem</em></p>\n<p>One of the highlights from last years <em><strong>The Rip Tide</strong></em>, and an excellent choice.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9p1l5HRd36o\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Alarm clock in Blood’s house – <strong>Katrina and the Waves</strong> –<em> Walking On Sunshine</em></p>\n<p>Predictable, but I presume that’s what they were going for. Why Rich needed to throw the alarm clock out the window, I do not know.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPUmE-tne5U\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Rich watches tapes of Grace – <strong>Lucy Rose</strong> – <em>Don’t You Worry</em></p>\n<p>Cute little track, fitted in nicely to the atmosphere of the scene.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwWFN-nBxhA\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Hospital phone holding music – <strong>Phil Collins</strong> – <em>Easy Lover</em></p>\n<p>Classic, slightly tongue in cheek as well.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnDYattQH3Y\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Rich sits alone in Grace’s room –<strong> Apparat</strong> –<em> Black Water</em></p>\n<p>Used twice in the episode (see last track), although it’s a truly glorious composition, so you can’t really blame them.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUAZd-zK38w\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Rich and Alo fight – <strong>Lorena</strong> – <em>Guadalupe Plata</em></p>\n<p>Fuzzy, upbeat rock rather fitting for the comical feel to the ‘fight’.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPlP0xcymZ4\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Rider pulls up in his car – <strong>The Game</strong> – <em>Put You On The Game</em></p>\n<p>Dis-likable, arrogant guy plays dis-likable, arrogant track. Yada yada yada.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyaPTpWWRcY\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Party at Blood’s house – <strong>Fuck Norris</strong> – <em>We Are One</em></p>\n<p>Again, horribly contrived yet drenched in sarcasm.</p>\n<p>Rich looks for Grace – <strong>Boddika</strong> – <em>You Tell Me</em></p>\n<p>A fantastic producer, although perhaps wasn’t the best opportunity to use this track. Could possibly have done with a faster paced composition.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LikrqCabRE\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"35\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Rich and Grace sex scene – <strong>Segal</strong> – <em>Vessels</em></p>\n<p>This Segal guy must have a deal with Skins. A little too Skrillex for me.</p>\n<p>Rich discovers Grace has died – <strong>Apparat</strong> – <em>Black Water</em></p>\n<p>Used again. A fairly moving scene, and a perfectly fitting track.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F17489547&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14491-feature-the-music-from-skins-s6-e2","category":"editorials","date":1327963383000,"wpid":14491,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292978690,"updatedAt":1588441783069,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/01/screen-shot-2012-01-30-at-23.41.21-950x454.png","categories":["editorials","music"]}
