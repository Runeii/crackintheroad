Maximo Park? The Futureheads? Kubichek? All good artists in their own right, yet there’s an underlying feeling with all of them, that when it came to jumping the final hurdle and shooting themselves towards the festival headlining slots, they all hit the proverbial stumbling block. After earlier this week meeting up with the new troubadours of North East music, Athletes In Paris, it’s clear these guys are determined not to slip up anywhere alone their way to stardom. From their electric live performances, to their rock and roll swagger, Athletes In Paris are here to stay, whether you like it or not.</p>\n<p>Debut single Borrowed Time, released at the start of next month on The Animal Farm signals a clear show of intent. A three minute stomper written about the turbulence experienced towards the final stages of a relationship, it’s already a live favourite and it’s not difficult to hear why. “How many lies have you had me swallow?” moans lead singer Matt, it’s danceable, energetic and all too human, three very important aspects of modern day indie music. Listen to Borrowed Time below, and keep checking back for our full interview with Athletes in Paris.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F10881113\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F10881113\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/athletesinparis/borrowed-time\">Borrowed Time</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/athletesinparis\">Athletes in Paris</a></span></p>\n","slug":"5284-review-athletes-in-paris-borrowed-time","category":"music","date":1300893329000,"wpid":5284,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/06/l2-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587294609004,"updatedAt":1588403558652,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/l2-188x188.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
