I’m feeling some real FKA Twigs influence in the general vibe of this track, dealing with fears of entrapment, alongside those of lust and love. Another extremely promising step forward.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191278937&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30910-new-lyves-shelter","category":"music","date":1424134319000,"wpid":30910,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2048,"height":1074,"src":"2015/02/10984555_1007795759249551_2035393911068522834_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAGRAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwRx/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQT/xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDFOjV7PXG0nMyqXpIaAHVk0//Z"},"createdAt":1587281664172,"updatedAt":1588403510959,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2015/02/10984555_1007795759249551_2035393911068522834_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
