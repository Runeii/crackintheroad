{"id":"5e9c31429b6559241525dce3","title":"New: Sons & Daughters – Silver Spell","content":"<p>Every so often a band re-appears with a new track that is so startlingly different and such a comprehensive volte-face that you struggle to believe it is the same band.</p><p> Glasgow four piece Sons & Daughters have done just that with the first release from their forthcoming fourth album.</p>\n<p>“Silver Spell” completely jettisons the spiky, insistent punk guitars that characterized their first two records in favour of doom laden dark synths and cold foreboding electronics. The band have enlisted the production talents of JD Switch from Glasgow electro DJ duo Optimo for the new record and his influence is all over this first single. The stark bare sound is staggeringly effective and bodes well for what should be a very interesting fourth album, we wait with baited breath for more.</p>\n<p>“Mirror Mirror” is released though Domino records on 14 June.
