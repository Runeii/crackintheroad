This new act from California (the project of <strong>Ryan Santos Phillips</strong>) goes to show exactly why you shouldn’t jump to conclusions, as <strong>Spirit of Leo</strong> explodes onto the scene with one of the finest underground releases of the year.</p><p></p>\n<p>This debut four track EP is a glorious combination of everything that’s great about lo-fi ‘bedroom-style’ production, fusing a vast range influences into a product of immeasurable beauty.</p>\n<p>Bringing about recollections of the likes of<strong> Pale Saints</strong>, <strong>Ride</strong>, and of course, a slightly more pop-orientated <strong>My Bloody Valentine</strong>,<strong> Spirits Of Leo</strong> is sincere, devastatingly honest and utterly beautiful. In more modern comparisons, there’s touches of <strong>Wild Nothing</strong> and<strong> Washed Out</strong>, in short, I’m lost for words.</p>\n<p><em>I stood aside and watched the worlds collide </em><br />\n<em>it wasn’t easy, but I kept my arms open wide </em><br />\n<em>Crystalline, so pristine </em><br />\n<em>(Your eyes) </em><br />\n<em>In reflections, there’s endless imperfections </em><br />\n<em>don’t trust the mirror, bloody Mary likes to have her laughs </em><br />\n<em>Crystalline, so pristine </em><br />\n<em>(Your eyes)</em></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2493082545/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18844-introducing-spirits-of-leo","category":"introducing","date":1356562641000,"wpid":18844,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":950,"src":"2012/12/2400662360-1-950x950.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgUI/8QAHBAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQRITES/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANGW7ssVtkLGAh3neCenaoHqLUkFWkQAv//Z"},"createdAt":1587284299023,"updatedAt":1588443771179,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/12/2400662360-1-950x950.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
