With their dark yet somehow alluring imagery and unfathomable name, they’re intriguing from the get go, and it’s an aesthetic that perfectly suits their melancholic shoegaze sound. Taking inspiration from the likes of <strong>Ride</strong> and <strong>Slowdive</strong>, the guitars are languid and drowned in distortion whilst the vocals are poignant and distinctively clear, even if they are sung in a foreign language (excuse my ignorance).
