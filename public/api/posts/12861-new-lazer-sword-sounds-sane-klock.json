They’ve released a split 12″ on Glasgow’s <strong>Numbers </strong>label, and an album on <strong>Innovative Leisure</strong>. Seperately, <strong>Lando</strong> has released stuff on <strong>Numbers</strong>, Amsterdam’s <strong>Rush Hour</strong> and London’s <strong>Hotflush</strong>, whilst <strong>Low Limit</strong> has put out on Manchester’s <strong>Fat City</strong>. So these guys are hardly new to the scene.</p>\n<p>However, this new release is via <strong>Modeselektor</strong>‘s <strong>Monkeytown Records</strong>, and is some absolutely vital dance music. It seems they’ve been working towards a particular aesthetic, and they’ve nailed it. Both sides are examples of the perfect medley of house, robotic vocals, garage, funky and techno – an electronic fruit salad. The synths in <em>Sounds Sane</em> hit me almost as hard as in <strong>Joy Orbison</strong>‘s first outings. The 808 cowbell on the B-side, <em>Klock </em>is staggeringly catchy amongst the shuffling drums. Both tracks are very very adaptive, and are going to go down a treat on our shores, that’s for sure. By the way, not only are <strong>Monkeytown</strong> releasing this, but an album is following in late April. After hearing this, I for one can’t wait that long.</p>\n<p><em>Stream both tracks below. Sounds Sane b/w Klock is out now via download/10″ on Monkeytown Records.</em></p>\n<p><center><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28996627&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28996627&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object></p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28996413&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28996413&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object><center></p>\n","slug":"12861-new-lazer-sword-sounds-sane-klock","category":"music","date":1322408800000,"wpid":12861,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":950,"src":"2011/11/lazersword-950x950.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMEB//EAB0QAAICAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMEERIhQeH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMOoyXfNep6nQbJ6K79n5LeWjAT3YN+OjC1KD//Z"},"createdAt":1587293370712,"updatedAt":1588443777075,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/11/lazersword-950x950.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
