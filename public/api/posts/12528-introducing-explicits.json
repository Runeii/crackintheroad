However, after a considerable amount of digging, I discovered that <strong>Explicits</strong> is the new project of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/800beloved/20490718553\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>800beloved</strong></a> main man <strong>Sean Lynch</strong>. Having released a minute long teaser video entitled<em> revoL</em> (Lover spelled backwards) just under five months ago, featuring a downbeat, instrumental track and flashing imagery, it’s bizarre that the hype hasn’t quite built up to higher levels.</p>\n<p>Another grainy black and white video followed three months later, this time entitled <em>Lover</em>, and showing who I assume is Lynch, performing a subdued acoustic number. Atmospheric and seductive, the track itself is <strong>Joy Division</strong>-esque in nature, brooding and remorseful, proving wonderfully exposed.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/28578076?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/28578076\">Lover</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user588709\">Explicits</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>With the year drawing to a close,<strong> Explicits</strong> have made two new cuts available via their <a href=\"https://explicits.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> page as well as the full version of <em>revoL</em>. Released under the title <em><strong>The Uncanny Valley</strong>, </em><del>it’s unclear as to whether this will form a full release or an EP</del> which will be<strong> Lynch’s</strong> debut full length release under the Explicits moniker.. The entirely instrumental <em>RAM</em> serves well as an opening track, drawling and languid, providing a stable platform for what’s to come. In fact, whilst writing this article I noticed that <em>revoL</em> was added to the bandcamp page, and it’s a stunning ambient inspired number, with the vocals playing a pivotal role alongside the sampled female spoken word sections.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2250937761/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>As I begin to compile end of year lists, it’s showing me that it’s going to take something special to muscle it’s way into my final choices, and <em>US</em> may well do just that. Again, there’s a real late 70’s feel to the track, with it’s unique brand of emotional downbeat pop. The vocals are smooth and harrowing at times, as are the poignant lyrics, “<em>baby we should drive away, where no one will find us</em>“. To be honest, I’m still coming to terms with just how sublime this track is, with it’s raw power and pure elegant simplicity. Check out <em>US</em> below, and stay tuned for updates on what is sure to be a bright future for <strong>Explicits</strong> and <strong>Sean Lynch</strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=996118619/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Here’s a collection of five tracks from <em><strong>The Uncanny Valley</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27965725\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27965725\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object>  <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/explicits/side-b-gemini-mp60-tape\">SIDE B /// GEMINI /// MP60 /// TAPE</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/explicits\">Explicits</a></span> </p>\n","slug":"12528-introducing-explicits","category":"introducing","date":1321215618000,"wpid":12528,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293481576,"updatedAt":1588441786489,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/658386bf10ea46a597e711fd85ea0abf855b00fe.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
