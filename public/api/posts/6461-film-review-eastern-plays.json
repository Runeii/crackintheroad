We follow Itso aka Christo (<em>Christo Christov</em>) and his brother Georgi (<em>Ovanes Torosian</em>) as they struggle to find themselves in Sofia, a city slowly being torn apart through racial violence.  Christo is an artist recovering from a heroin addiction, an addiction that has lead him to an alcohol problem, as he tries to pull his life around. Georgi meanwhile is involved in the Neo-Nazi movement that is sweeping the city. The characters, despite their obvious flaws, are utterly human. Kalev manages not only to capture the mending of a strained relationship between the two men, but also succeeds in creating characters you route for despite their actions.</p>\n<p>Initially the film’s style is strongly social-realist. The violent act that pulls the various characters of the film together could possibly make one believe that the film would focus on the culture of the city and this alone. What follows however is a poignant character study that although mismatched in places, ultimately finds a way of lifting the soul.</p>\n","slug":"6461-film-review-eastern-plays","category":"arts","date":1302292550000,"wpid":6461,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/04/easternplays-292x50.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAACCAYAAABhYU3QAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAXUlEQVR4nAFSAK3/AAcNEf8wNzr/kaSk/4+goP9vZl3/aWJS/19aT/9bWFD/nayq/4uhoP8AEBMQ/x4iIv9kcG3/YXBw/2BeVv9qYlH/f3lt/4F3bf+LlZH/eo+N/7nvK804I5nUAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"},"createdAt":1587294527837,"updatedAt":1588443778972,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/04/easternplays-292x50.png","categories":["arts"]}
