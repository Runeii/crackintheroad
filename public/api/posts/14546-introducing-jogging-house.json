Moving between a range of tempos with a endearingly calm grace, the EP holds influences of RnB, while infusing this with an air of melancholy. Make sure to check out ‘<strong>Why?</strong>‘ in particular.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3907562647/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14546-introducing-jogging-house","category":"introducing","date":1328191931000,"wpid":14546,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292958725,"updatedAt":1588441782938,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2012/02/picture-5-165x163.png","categories":["introducing","music"]}
