Despite engaging and respecting the more conformed aspects of what instrumental hip-hop can often be. Sometimes a catchy loop isn’t enough. The beat is never the window dressing to the flow. While saying this, its arguable that <strong>Mute</strong>’s music is damaged by the missing element, a great MC. When <strong>Mute</strong> has this he could, in my opinion, be the whole package.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F101011694\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F95747982\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23022-new-mute-all-the-lovesong-and-dance-man","category":"music","date":1373827360000,"wpid":23022,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2013/07/allthelove.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgAH/8QAIhAAAgAGAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFETGRBgcSI1Jh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEUH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AF0rcu5lhraBLzaaq52liFfMtGqACdkq2cj9jeVYFQdZGjuGZUvJ9acCLwX5XiDJQzt//9k="},"createdAt":1587283279162,"updatedAt":1588403529176,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/07/allthelove.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
