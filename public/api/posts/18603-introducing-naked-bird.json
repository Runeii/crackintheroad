The project of Selena Vernon of <strong>Sister Wife</strong> and Jeik Hanson of <strong>Beach Baby</strong>, Naked Bird fit snuggly into the boy-girl two piece that appears to be so popular at this moment in time, however their production methods and songwriting are far more unorthodox than their contemporaries.</p>\n<p>For one, in an age when instrumental sections can be all to easy to piece together and vocals harder to produce, it’s strange that<strong> Naked Bird</strong> seem to find it the other way round, with the stunning vocals of Vernon rarely slipping up, whilst the production on the backing music occasionally lacking a sharpness and direction, albeit one that will come in time. Take Heavy Heart, a track with as good a hook as you’re likely to hear this year, however the lo-fi production leaves it meandering off course, a shame really considering the strength of the other components that go into the song. Ultimately, <strong>Naked Bird</strong> needs more grandiose production, especially if they’re to be pushed to a wider audience. That said, for now, it’s a promising debut from the duo, and hopefully a signal of intent of what is to come.</p>\n<p>Check out their debut two track release, The Feast, below, and download it from <a href=\"https://nakedbird.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2851752?\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18603-introducing-naked-bird","category":"introducing","date":1354749499000,"wpid":18603,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284396464,"updatedAt":1587825883867,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
