Playing on Sunday on the Golden Voice Stage, <strong>SMD </strong>will provide the style of music that the large majority of the Rockness crowd listen to regularly with brilliant tunes from their 4 studio albums. <em>Attack Decay Sustain Release</em>, their debut album, is arguably their best work with songs such as <em>I Believe </em>and <em>Hustler </em>which are both hopefully on their set list this Sunday; and if so will provide delight to undoubtedly a large audience.</p>\n<p>Already playing gigs elsewhere on both the Friday and Saturday preceding their performance at <strong>Rockness </strong>it is certain that the guys will have their set polished and perfected. <strong>James Ford</strong> himself has just finished producing <strong>Arctic Monkeys’ </strong>new album which was released yesterday so it has been a busy time for the guys, <strong>Ford </strong>especially. <strong>Crack in the Road</strong> intend to be there and we are most definitely looking forward to seeing this act in particular. With <strong>Boys Noize </strong>on, and headlining, the Golden Voice Stage it will be a tough choice for many festival-goers between them and the Main Stage with <strong>Paulo Nutini </strong>and <strong>Glasvegas</strong> due to perform simultaneously.</p>\n","slug":"8411-rockness-tip-simian-mobile-disco","category":"music","date":1307467486000,"wpid":8411,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/06/new-smd-21-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgQH/8QAIhAAAgEEAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFBhEhURIUIzFh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQP/xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIR0f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8At3KztcDh4ZrqSNFu5UjgNsqsy+o9dMOPI5/PqiUe36usarJjLh3AAZvZoeT5pXtRMr4VJSXRWPCt2B8dYrLczrK4WaUAMQAGPVUaAAwbKbyf/9k="},"createdAt":1587294309792,"updatedAt":1588403554454,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d07","old_image":"2011/06/new-smd-21-165x165.jpg","categories":["music"]}
