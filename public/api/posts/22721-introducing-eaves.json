Drawing immediate comparisons to the likes of Villagers, Alexi Murdoch, Eddie Vedder, and the great Jeff Buckley, Eaves’ small collection of demos are achingly beautiful.</p>\n<p>Little Rock is full of enlightening subtleties, completely capturing the listener’s attention and covering itself over their mind as a healing rub. If this is the quality of a demo, we cannot wait to hear this potential realised in a fully fledged release.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F97967423\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22721-introducing-eaves","category":"introducing","date":1371913358000,"wpid":22721,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283351082,"updatedAt":1588441764964,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/c9b54db1b213b5f2faa237fabd470839a8b454b4.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
