Now returning with their third offering, in the form of the bullishly confident <em>Jade</em>, an ode to “<i>lonely souls interacting in hopes of finding instant satisfaction” </i>it deals with the essence of loss and euphoria in scintillating style. Merging elements of the likes of MØ and Broods, Jade manages to feel strikingly elegant whilst also being unnervingly honest.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/342308546&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33932-premiere-beffroi-jade","category":"music","date":1505476099000,"wpid":33932,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1536,"height":1024,"src":"2017/09/29_0354.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAIxAAAQIFAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFESETIjEGEhRBcf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIhEv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AzVElqCnp+Xl5uWDjaF+Y8tlOkpSh3bb87cnBANh8igt2joUUtVJ3TSbJuXibesnmEIdTXYrvQT//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587279809232,"updatedAt":1588403498708,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2017/09/29_0354.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
