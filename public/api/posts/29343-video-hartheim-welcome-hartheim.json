They have now released visuals to accompany their brutally vulnerable  single <em>Welcome To Hartheim. </em>The video features the juxtaposition of beautiful and elegant choreography against the ominous aesthetic portrayed by the track. It’s a dark and disturbing affair, but one that is wholly captivating and enthralling. I said it before and I’ll say it again; What a bloody powerful outro.</p>\n<p>Check out the Jack Bottomley directed visuals above.</p>\n","slug":"29343-video-hartheim-welcome-hartheim","category":"music","date":1407156388000,"wpid":29343,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282016292,"updatedAt":1588441755430,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273c30c1e7f745ef60c55a6aed0.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
