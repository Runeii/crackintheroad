Having <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/12524-introducing-cholombian/\" target=\"_blank\">Introduced</a> Stevens toward the tail end of last year, he’s increased his fanbase with the release of two EP’s, March’s<em><strong> Distance</strong></em> and last weeks<strong><em> Before You, It Never Snowed</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Switching from drone based soundscapes to sampling mid-00’s <strong>Usher</strong> within the space of seconds, (<em>You Don’t Even Know What You’ve Done</em>), it’s within <strong>Cholombian’s</strong> flexibility that he really excels, toying with complex beat structures and dark, industrial synth sounds. <em>Kiss The Ring</em> finds him borrowing vocal samples again, this time from <strong>Wu Tang</strong>, before the track descends into a mirage of atmospheric, metallic claps. Whilst it’s still early days for <strong>Cholombian</strong>, he’s rapidly building up a mightily impressive catalog of work.
