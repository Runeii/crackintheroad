Exal’s music is simply perfect for this time and this moment. The sun is shining, every piece of grass in the city seems to completely covered in people and a palpable layer of optimism seems to linger within conversations and glances with strangers.</p>\n<p>But what of the music? <strong>Exal</strong>’s new EP, out tomorrow on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/housewarmingrecords\">Housewarming Records</a>, is a jittering break/trance/ambient slice of sun. Its primary aim is to compliment the season we welcome so warmly every year; bright, lush and transient textures glisten off every track, it seems to come with an almost paradoxical sadness that comes with the end of a summers day complete with a warming shiver of satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Find someone you love, sit back, relax.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2394556659/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15864-exclusive-premiere-exal-stranger-in-the-lights","category":"music","date":1332950511000,"wpid":15864,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292608204,"updatedAt":1588441779531,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/03/exal-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
