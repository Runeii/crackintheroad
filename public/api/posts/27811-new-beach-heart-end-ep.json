There’s somewhat of a bedroom pop aesthetic to Beach Heart; that is if the bedroom was at the top of the Hollywood Hills, overlooking the glistening neon landscape below.</p>\n<p>His most recent release, <i>The End EP</i>, is a collection of tracks that encapsulates the sound of <b>Beach Heart</b>. With a string of previous releases over the past two years, racking up a few thousand plays, this is his most coherent work to date, bringing together everything I have grown to love about him since I stumbled across his music a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/27078944&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Describing himself as <i>‘Bittersweet Dream Pop’</i>, this is summer time pop at heart, built for the wooziness of the long, drawn out months of friends, road trips and beach fires. But there’s something slightly darker and atmospheric underneath this electro pop haze, a sense of nostalgia and longing perhaps. At times Lawrence’s vocals are not too dissimilar to the soft, echoing call of <b>Washed Out’s</b> Ernest Greene, all of which are set to a hazy electronic backbone, drenched in reverb.</p>\n<p>From the pumping bass of lead track <i>Hold On, Let Go</i> to the chirpy blurts and contorted electronics of <i>New Year</i>, The End is a fantastic release, full of excitement and promise. <i>This is Not the End</i> is the perfect closer, a somber though thoroughly uplifting affair and is a certain highlight of what is quite simply, a lovely listen. Lets hope that title echoes the future of <b>Beach Heart’s</b> music.</p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"27811-new-beach-heart-end-ep","category":"new","date":1397135504000,"wpid":27811,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282235416,"updatedAt":1588441758867,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d46","old_image":"generated/fe010007d47d695fa093cbe29be001e1d17f6dce.jpg","categories":["new"]}
