Their newest track, Your Sword Is My Silence, is a resplendent, atmospheric affair, pirouetting cautiously through sleek, over-emphasised vocals and a pronounced rhythm section. Never quite giving in to it’s Cocteau Twins inspiration, and unfurling into an epic anthem, <strong>Saa</strong> prefer to toy with the minimal and the spacious beauty that they conjure up.</p>\n<p>Your Sword Is Your Silence is out 8 July on prestigious London label Left Blank.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F93374365\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22085-new-saa-your-sword-is-your-silence","category":"music","date":1369419997000,"wpid":22085,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283468559,"updatedAt":1588441766201,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/65e0349883b2c0e1aa2ce5cc86b00cbcbf44100c.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
