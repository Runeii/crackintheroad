Alongside one of the most distinct deliveries of any new artist,<strong> King Krule</strong> also has the rare gift of being able to speak on behalf of a generation of talented, yet flawed adolescents. With the half spoken / half rapped vocals and minimalist beat, it’s sure to build excitement for the full release.</p>\n<p><em>I want to be with you / I want to be used</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/wQf3A2ohX7c\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23793-new-king-krule-neptune-estate","category":"music","date":1376343997000,"wpid":23793,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":110,"src":"2013/08/king-krule1-165x110.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIhAAAQMCBgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhESEyExQVGB/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgP/xAAZEQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADESH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMrw1bLNJwxcxLYeduy4qpEZzWUoa0rKMuOyTl349VPOWK5NOKbXGIWklJG4ngj7SlOtAx7I3WlMyf/Z"},"createdAt":1587283100369,"updatedAt":1588443767687,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/king-krule1-165x110.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
