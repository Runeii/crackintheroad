Music, and indeed anticipation for music, would never be the same again. Throughout those bittersweet 11 months, there was even talk that <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jai-Paul/205258999506990\">Jai Paul</a></strong> had quit music all together. Not so, his new cut, <strong><em>Jasmine</em></strong>, finally puts that rumour to bed. It’s late, I’m ill and I’m going to bed, so I won’t bore you with my thoughts on the track.</p>\n<p>Let’s just say it’s the best thing I’ve heard all year. Welcome back Mr. Paul.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F41479635&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15936-new-jai-paul-jasmine","category":"music","date":1333140928000,"wpid":15936,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1000,"height":516,"src":"2012/03/jai-paul-.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAIRAAAQMEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEBSExEiIjYZH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBf/EABkRAQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhEhIv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AyqHrizw68fj3lNWD9x1lhzyCZCZk93HuN8VQh9AQkKS4SBuHIHyKUo2Fh2UKLQ88n//Z"},"createdAt":1587292587622,"updatedAt":1588403540362,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/03/jai-paul-.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
