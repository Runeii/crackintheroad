I am running scared. Mining ever deeper for some unknown fuel that will set my heart alight again, I am beset by charlatans, sirens, snake oil salesmen peddling a cure that I so sorely want, but so rarely get my quivering hands on. But for now at least, I have found solace in the music of three young women from Copenhagen, calling themselves <strong>Baby In Vain</strong>.</p>\n<p>That they’ve had the moxy to dub the welter of pseudo-western squall and bluesy grind up there <em>Corny #1 </em>is great. Just fucking great. Baby In Vain <em>know </em>they ain’t savin’ your life, they ain’t pullin’ the wool from your eyes, they ain’t reinventin’ the fucking wheel. But our holy mother in heaven, will this whiskey-soaked melee of guitars and drums ever make your rickety hips <em>swing, </em>stoner’s abyssal fuzz subsumed by post-punk treble and sneer. Baby In Vain know their compadres on this neverending road, they nod to their elder statespeople as equals, and they couldn’t give a flying fuck about who you think they sound like. If this is corny, well hell, I couldn’t care a whit for originality.</p>\n<p><em>Baby In Vain play the Old Blue Last on Monday 12th May, with Skinny Girl Diet and The Franklys in tow. Fucken git some. </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"28181-introducing-baby-vain","category":"introducing","date":1398880351000,"wpid":28181,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1280,"height":800,"src":"2014/04/babyinvain-1280x800.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIBAAAgEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCAAQFERIxQQciUf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAJB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCSyGNCMEqzurtpshZ27mxUuIl3L1JPI+nmtPj4vwDYhgL5CY3bmCJkdezoOaUonCUaS//Z"},"createdAt":1587282161260,"updatedAt":1588403516743,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"2014/04/babyinvain-1280x800.jpg","categories":["introducing","news","music"]}
