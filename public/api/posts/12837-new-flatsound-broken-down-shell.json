Check.</p><p> Gritty, lo-fi production? Check. Heart-wrenching, emotionally distraught lyrics? Check. <strong>Flatsound</strong>, you know me too well. Having released one of my favourite albums of the year in the form of <em><strong>I Clung To You Hoping We’d Both Drown</strong></em>, <strong>Flatsound</strong> has dropped new track <em>Broken Down Shell</em> as a free download. Again, the <strong>Casiotone For The Painfully Alone</strong> and <strong>Bright Eyes</strong> influences are fairly prominent, but not over-empowering. These are personal stories straight from the gut to your ears; rarely has heartbreak sounded so good.</p>\n<p><em>you said things would stay the same, well have they? </em><br />\n<em> because it’s not that hard to describe yourself </em><br />\n<em> you’re a broken down shell of someone else </em><br />\n<em> that I used to know </em></p>\n<p><em> you move every winter </em><br />\n<em> I know you’re scared </em><br />\n<em> but you’ll never get better </em><br />\n<em> if you keep running away </em><br />\n<em> and you smoke way too often </em><br />\n<em> I know you ride bikes </em><br />\n<em> but you’re always coughing </em><br />\n<em> so I’m a little scared </em></p>\n<p><em> now it’s not that hard to describe yourself </em><br />\n<em> you’re a broken down shell of someone else </em><br />\n<em> that I used to know</em></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2735305/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12837-new-flatsound-broken-down-shell","category":"mpfree","date":1322170946000,"wpid":12837,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":375,"src":"2011/11/313429_269835186372130_108771852478465_939621_1855446394_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHhAAAgICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAASIjETQeH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEhH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMpu260wsxrSQRyP5Iyw5KCOu8nFgr6jZ3B98fuMZeQDk6Vv/9k="},"createdAt":1587293383883,"updatedAt":1588403544517,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/11/313429_269835186372130_108771852478465_939621_1855446394_n.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
