Of their glitchy, sagacious set, one track in particular caught my attention; the remarkably peerless <em>Seeing The Same</em>. Handsome vocal sections echo with a heavenly resonance, building to each swirling, pinacle. Quite truly a masterpiece of a track.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F94351419\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22540-new-solar-year-seeing-the-same","category":"music","date":1371239338000,"wpid":22540,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283391991,"updatedAt":1588441765476,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27338b42e999c7e4ccaebfbbe37.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
