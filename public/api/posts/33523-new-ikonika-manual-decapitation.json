{"id":"5e9bf8078fb2d30d7769c8e8","title":"New: Ikonika – Manual Decapitation","content":"<p>London based producer Ikonika returns with new track <em>Manual Decapitation </em>in the lead up to her new album Distractions.</p><p> The song itself is far more accessible than its name might suggest. The opening synth arpeggio is reminiscent of Flume’s recent track Enough featuring Pusha T, but manages to retain a smooth eerie sound throughout in contrast to Flume’s more abrasive choice of tone. The inclusion of bells and ghostly vocals that sit low in the mix give the track a real sense of depth, while the subtle changes Ikonika plays with in the synths keeps the songs emotional tonality in constant fluctuation. Check out the beautiful Manual Decapitation below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F314277655&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"33523-new-ikonika-manual-decapitation","category":"uncategorized","date":1492099361000,"wpid":33523,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1024,"height":683,"src":"2017/04/ikonika-1-1024x683.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYI/8QAHhAAAgEEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAYREgUhUQT/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAzH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJiz7rHCXN80ixSPBBIu2HxgKx3IHpHVamHIO42RyVPYPopSlgHYsP/Z"},"createdAt":1587279879617,"updatedAt":1588403501197,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"2017/04/ikonika-1-1024x683.jpg","categories":["uncategorized"]}
