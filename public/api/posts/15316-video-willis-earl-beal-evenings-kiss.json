Progressive shit. Skin pigment complexities aside, Beal happens to be one of the most exciting (anti) folk artists to emerge this year, and with XL due to drop an LP some time this year, the future is undoubtedly bright.</p>\n<p>The new video for his new single, ‘<strong><em>Evening’s kiss</em></strong>’, mirrors the track’s fragility perfectly, with the stop motion illustrations flickering with a sober murmur of awkward resilience. It actually reminds me of the film <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk2DeTet98o\">Waking Life</a></em></strong> by <strong>Richard Linklater</strong>, but that could just be me.</p>\n<p>Stream the video below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhrlEGJRPqM\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15316-video-willis-earl-beal-evenings-kiss","category":"music","date":1330213418000,"wpid":15316,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292761493,"updatedAt":1588441780779,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/02/willis-earl-beal--165x165.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
