Actress first gained a small amount of attention when he released his <em>No Tricks</em> EP back in 2004. After spending a long time writing and promoting his label with influential and important releases from Lukid and dubstep producer Zomby, he finally released his debut LP <em>Hazyville</em> with very high expectations. Although lacking a little in variation, the ambience drenched LP was a short but defining record, clearly displaying Actressâ€™ talent in making original and interesting music.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.honestjons.com/doc_library/Originals/36068.jpg\"><img style=\"cursor: hand; width: 170px; height: 170px;\" src=\"https://www.honestjons.com/doc_library/Originals/36068.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Soon to release his second album entitled <em>Splazsh, </em>Actress has built a fairly large buzz.<em> <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Releasing two tracks with Zomby on his blog, an EP entitled <em>Machine and Voice</em> on NonPlus and the single <em>Paint, Straw and Bubbles</em> which includes and remix from Zomby and the album track </span><span>Maze</span><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. For me, the highlight of these releases is Maze, an instantly addictive track built on a base of brutal pulsating synth and a stunning hook that immediately demands your attention, layered with rhythmically arranged bleeps and clicks. </span></em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><br />\n</span></em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Actress will soon release his second album Splazsh on a date currently unknown. </span></em></div>\n<div><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0pNmTmYqcc\">Maze (youtube)</a> </strong></div>\n<div><strong><a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2010/01/08/zomby-and-actress-za-mp3s/\">Actress/Zomby Tracks</a></strong></div>\n<div><strong><a href=\"https://www.honestjons.com/shop.php?pid=36069&g=1\">Buy</a></strong></div>\n<div><strong><br />\n</strong></div>\n","slug":"10-actress","category":"music","date":1270305180000,"wpid":10,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":460,"src":"2010/04/actress.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIRAAAQIGAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMRAAIEBQYhEhNBBxT/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQIh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCT9AvltyvMaDFFUOuho7klTrVfa8xWmLMEw2tceT6clvI3j8so0AAB5CEXvkBOn//Z"},"createdAt":1587295392750,"updatedAt":1588403569570,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d18","old_image":"2010/04/actress.jpg","categories":["music"]}
