Having recently performed sold out shows across the UK, along with dates in the USA, Pixies have returned strongly with the release of new material and the sudden departure of Kim Deal. Their performance at Primavera Sound 2014 will no doubt be highly anticipated, especially in tandem to appearances of both Arcade Fire and Neutral Milk Hotel who both have recently returned to sold out live tours.</p>\n<p>If I were you, I’d get your tickets bought now.</p>\n<p>More details can be found at <a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/news/25080-news-pixies-announced-play-primavera-sound-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">www.primaverasound.com</a></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lGdSYPh5_BI\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25080-news-pixies-announced-play-primavera-sound-2014","category":"news","date":1385980120000,"wpid":25080,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":425,"height":425,"src":"2013/12/primavera.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAf/xAAgEAADAAICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAFIgYHEiFB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AKn6smuZ7idd2U+47PHjhOqVxZvQBjNmbwRfFg+9N8vwDXKlCq2jOq7CuoYAjR0RwtsXHalGaEi297KDfGqAFAAAAH0BwP/Z"},"createdAt":1587282734447,"updatedAt":1588403524506,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2013/12/primavera.jpg","categories":["news"]}
