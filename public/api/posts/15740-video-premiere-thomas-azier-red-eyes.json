{"id":"5e9c29dc9b6559241525d3e9","artists":["5e9b69577a1236eccfeb2660"],"title":"Video Premiere: Thomas Azier – Red Eyes","content":"<p>With his darkpop influences and self-described synth obsession, <a href=\"https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/thomasazier\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Thomas Azier</strong></a> is an admirably unique artist. His debut EP released in January, entitled <em><strong>Hylas 001 </strong></em>(available to stream after the jump) is a stomping collection of hook heavy, charmingly infectious pop gems, filling the expansive void between <strong>Depeche Mode</strong> and <strong>Hurts</strong> with a sterling sense of youthful energy and vibrancy. There’s a bewitching, emotional atmosphere conjured up by <strong>Azier</strong> that numerous artists attempt to replicate, yet most fall acres short of the mark.</p>\n<p>With the aforementioned EP rapidly finding it’s way into ears around the UK, we’re delighted to be able to offer the very first viewing of the visuals that accompany lead single <em>Red Eyes</em>. Contrasting intimate relationships with desolate, disconnected environments (e.g. a packed night club, a concrete tower block), <strong>Azier</strong> transcends genre boundaries, to bring us a work that is as deeply personal as it is instantaneously relatable. Check out the video for <em>Red Eyes</em> below, and stream the <em><strong>Hylas EP</strong></em> underneath that and keep up to date with <strong>Thomas</strong> via his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thomasazier\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sFp2hN_XXc\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1458196&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15740-video-premiere-thomas-azier-red-eyes","category":"music","date":1332410004000,"wpid":15740,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":633,"src":"2012/03/325248_225734284167736_116006125140553_509404_1159961137_o-950x633.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYI/8QAIBAAAQMEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQFESEGEiIxYv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDPtutdE7iFddJR3c2dkAjOQ5uiewcNb9YwVM+H0iIP/9k="},"createdAt":1587292636716,"updatedAt":1588443774993,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/03/325248_225734284167736_116006125140553_509404_1159961137_o-950x633.jpg","categories":["music","videos"]}
