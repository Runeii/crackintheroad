Documenting a time of great personal struggle, Someone Else is one of the highlights of their forthcoming LP <strong><em>Crawling Up The Stairs,</em></strong><em> </em>out 14 May. Emotional doesn’t even come close.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84467013\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20497-new-pure-x-someone-else","category":"mpfree","date":1364219272000,"wpid":20497,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283738573,"updatedAt":1588441768042,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/d356e30b319286a2b3f60d85cbe2036c71b60d08.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
