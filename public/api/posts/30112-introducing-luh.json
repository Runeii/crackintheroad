The themes are somewhat similar to those that WU LYF held dear; the breakdown of society, the creeping fear of capitalism and a yearning to break free. As with previous releases, it feels wonderfully disjointed, and slightly confused, yet undoubtedly inspiring. Check out Unites below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/108596953?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/108596953\">LUH UNITES</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/lostunderheaven\">LUH.</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172252833&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30112-introducing-luh","category":"introducing","date":1413540223000,"wpid":30112,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587281829140,"updatedAt":1588441753633,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/bfaaea71cb0d35487a2a7d0f7346daade56921f8.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
