{"id":"5e9bf9628fb2d30d7769cc55","artists":["5e9b693e7a1236eccfeb24e1"],"title":"New: Sarah Neufeld – ‘The Ridge’","content":"<p>Arcade Fire violinist Sarah Neufeld has announced an estimated release date for her upcoming album, <em>The Ridge</em>, and shared the title track from the LP online.</p><p></p>\n<p>The Canadian musician – whose capabilities extend well beyond the violin, to keyboard and backing vocals – already has 2013’s <em>Hero Brother</em> and the <em>Black Ground</em> EP (2014) behind her, and looks to follow hot on the heels from these two records with this confident, forward-looking project.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F233498913&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Which isn’t to say that she’s been resting idle during the intervening time between the release of <em>Hero Brother</em> and her sophomore LP (not to mention the recording and touring of <em>Reflektor</em>). For one thing, she co-authored the well-received <em>Never Were the Way She Was</em> with Colin Stetson (a debut album for the American saxophonist, who has also played as part of Arcade Fire and Bon Iver), released earlier this year.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yF5W3fGfOVU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>On the evidence of this short excerpt from her latest project, the scope of <em>Ridges</em> looks to be even more grand and sweeping than a lot of the stuff she’s done with Arcade Fire. The eight-minute-long song begins as an initially bright medley of strings and percussion, before taking several dips of tone, with the help of some clever vocal-layering and a number of sustained electronic drones.</p>\n<p>So, “Ridges” does make some use of Neufeld’s voice. But the way her voice is used is less as a lead vocalist – if anything, it’s more in line with the quasi-instrumental vocals the singer is known for with her now globally-recognised Canadian band (though, her kind of instrumental-vocals do grow into the articulation of some lyrics at around six minutes in). Another announcement made recently was that a number of drum additions, courtesy of Jeremy Gara (also of Arcade Fire), feature in the album. It’s most likely him, then, who provides the several sections of drumming – both tactile and robust – to this song.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F218982278&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n<p>You can listen here to the lead track from her forthcoming album. <em>The Ridge</em> is expected to be released in February 2016.</p>\n","slug":"31827-new-sarah-neufeld-ridge","category":"music","date":1448208030000,"wpid":31827,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1280,"height":800,"src":"2015/11/sn-high-res-1280x800.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEH/8QAIBAAAQMEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEBSEGFDFhof/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAHBEAAwACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABEEEyGh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDL+Q8gTa5DJ2XTQttl9LczEEgDQjxo+5quY1bbikKDRKSQSCd/KUqYt6caadTEbHvzFPCd2JooOs//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587280226222,"updatedAt":1588403508387,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d4a","old_image":"2015/11/sn-high-res-1280x800.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
