The records that followed the gear change were cleaner, more hip focused and all together more distinctive in their execution. Take his early drop, <strong><em><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/jezusmilli/benefits\">Benefits</a></em></strong>, half chillwave, half freak-hop, it was a jumbled and multi faceted take on hip-hop.</p>\n<p>If this new remix is anything to go by, it’s clear that we’re not the only ones impressed by Mr. <strong>Zucc</strong>o. His remix of <strong>Alex Winston</strong>’s Choice Notes is perhaps a more conservative effort, regardless, it’s smooth, effortless and gives the original a much needed kick into life.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36719164&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15151-new-alex-winston-choice-notes-jzus-million-remix","category":"music","date":1329592695000,"wpid":15151,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292804807,"updatedAt":1588441781284,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/0de5e5a8fd832819eacd78fc5d80a7b2f33a42e5.jpg","categories":["music","remixes","new"]}
