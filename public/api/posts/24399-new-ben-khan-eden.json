Prince-esque guitar lines, slick production and an early 00’s groove, it’s another hit in waiting. With little information circulating about Khan (probably not even his real name…), and him yet to play a live show,<em> Eden</em> is sure to have A&R’s even hotter on his heels.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F112562118\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24399-new-ben-khan-eden","category":"music","date":1380204721000,"wpid":24399,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282941793,"updatedAt":1588441762154,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ffe0853169dfa21cee86d80de65e2f034f7d766a.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
