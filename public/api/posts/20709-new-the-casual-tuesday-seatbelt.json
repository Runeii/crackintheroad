{"id":"5e9c06e8774c2610387e4f11","artists":["5e9b69517a1236eccfeb25f8"],"title":"New: The Casual Tuesday – Seatbelt","content":"<p>One of my most anticipated album releases of 2013 is from Oklahoma’s <strong>Tallows</strong>, having put out a couple of demos toward the end of last year, paired with an electrifying live show at SXSW, their melodic take on late 90’s Americana infused pop-punk is not too dissimilar to Dallas four piece <strong>The Casual Tuesday</strong>.</p><p> Whilst appearing to be still in their teens (I say that purely based upon photographs, apologies), their lyrical and songwriting capabilities far outshine their apparently modest years. New track <em>Seatbelt</em> is their first new recorded material in quite some time, and shows off an early <strong>Death Cab For Cutie</strong> inspired side to the group, slightly gritty, yet carefully pieced together indie pop. Opening with the gorgeous line “<em>We’re two stones falling towards the same sea / either to shatter or shink / we’ll see; please breathe</em>“, these are kids with true talent, and are more than worthy of your ears for a few minutes.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=336613632/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://thecasualtuesday0122.bandcamp.com/track/seatbelt\">Seatbelt by The Casual Tuesday</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20709-new-the-casual-tuesday-seatbelt","category":"mpfree","date":1364851176000,"wpid":20709,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283688053,"updatedAt":1588441767536,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/casual-51c22a0a6eb6e.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
