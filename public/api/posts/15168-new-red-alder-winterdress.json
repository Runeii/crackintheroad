The obstructed vocals and destitute ambient landscapes offer a cradle for the isolated and tender cries for help.</p>\n<p>The track’s hope, in my opinion, derives from the fragility of the speaker herself, the utterly helpless voice promotes an acute human urge to reach out; even if in this case, ‘reaching out’, is nothing more than staring wide eyed at my laptop’s screen. In any case, stopping, and hopefully caring is all that ‘<strong><em>Winterdress</em></strong>’ can hope for. And with this human urge to help a fellow human, comes the tracks gentle mirroring through its optimistic percussion arrangement; the stability and glimmer of hope, inspiring us to listen to the very end.</p>\n<p>via <a href=\"https://nofearofpop.net/2012/02/red-alder-winterdress/\">No Fear of Pop</a></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4094018409/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15168-new-red-alder-winterdress","category":"music","date":1329605422000,"wpid":15168,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292798637,"updatedAt":1588441781179,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/02/red-alder-925x520.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
