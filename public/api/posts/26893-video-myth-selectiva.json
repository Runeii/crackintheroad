I won’t pretend to understand how they did it, but the product is something that leaves me in awe. I think it’s probably because when I listen to a song I often imagine a video that would go with it and for the first time in a while an artist has already created my vision. Selectiva is the perfect combination of religious imagery appearing in clothing like Pyrex and classic movie sampling happening in all genres of music, but there’s nothing temporary or cliche about this track. It’s perfectly timeless.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/87019756\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"S e l e c t i v a\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26893-video-myth-selectiva","category":"music","date":1392824507000,"wpid":26893,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282403218,"updatedAt":1588441760250,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-18-at-10.04.57-pm-950x483.png","categories":["music","videos"]}
