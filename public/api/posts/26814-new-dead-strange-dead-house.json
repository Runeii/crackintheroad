Yet The Dead Strange don’t stop there, there’s touches of The Black Keys and 60’s psychedelic rock littered throughout the magical four minute course, making for the first great rock song of 2014.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/133954121&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"26814-new-dead-strange-dead-house","category":"music","date":1392765517000,"wpid":26814,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2014/02/dead-strange.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwUI/8QAJhAAAQIFAgYDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFERIGIQciMTZBQmFzsv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AKWtK/pNOo3hUVATLJaC8NgMjY+PUWJ+DCfLzsoGGw2yypGIxUE3uLbGMm8RO76r9g/Ah8pSlJpcmEqIAZQAAenKITMf/9k="},"createdAt":1587282404574,"updatedAt":1588403518861,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d44","old_image":"2014/02/dead-strange.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
