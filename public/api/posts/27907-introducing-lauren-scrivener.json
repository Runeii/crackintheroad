What really attracted me to her is the development her sound has taken on, one that is all too clear to witness from her Soundcloud, from the much more raw, rough round the edges, instrumental Reflection, to the pirouetting beauty of her most recent upload, Waiting For You. There’s some really great ideas going on here, and whilst it’s far from a ‘finished product’ in terms of music industry potential, that’s often the most exciting point to hear an artist at. Check out a couple of her tracks below, and more on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lauren-scrivener\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/114061631&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/110573755&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27907-introducing-lauren-scrivener","category":"introducing","date":1397397735000,"wpid":27907,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282223399,"updatedAt":1587825850429,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","music"]}
