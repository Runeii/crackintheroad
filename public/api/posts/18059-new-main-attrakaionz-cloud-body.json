Cloud Body is as much a celebration of Cloud Rap than anything else, but it does it with such passion and honesty it gets away with it in spades. This might not be the future of Hip-Hop just yet, but Main Attrakionz certainly think it is.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57861742&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18059-new-main-attrakaionz-cloud-body","category":"music","date":1349903657000,"wpid":18059,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284636433,"updatedAt":1588441774564,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/77c371fbf4a31965e6619ea856364220acd9aeb5.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
