Both tracks are rather frantic, energetic numbers, not taking themselves too seriously, whilst showing their ability to write catchy two minute pop songs. <em>Good Friends</em> showcases the <strong>Tokyo Police Club</strong>-esque slick vocals, with lead singer <strong>Tyler Broderick</strong> recounting<em> ‘oh I live for the stories that you tell, I live for these nights oh I live for hell’. </em>Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"355\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 355px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2516852382/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://diners.bandcamp.com/album/songs-from-throw-me-a-10\">Songs from \"Throw Me a 10\" by Diners</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15782-new-diners-how-to-live-good-friends","category":"music","date":1332530190000,"wpid":15782,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292627255,"updatedAt":1588441779665,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/14c7d8c5720bff3454d1e86dc599e814e5ca2b71.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
