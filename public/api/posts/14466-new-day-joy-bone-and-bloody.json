Almost like a less stadium refined <strong>Fleet Foxes</strong>, the addition of backing vocals work brilliantly, with the tracks most telling lyric coming towards the end “<em>I can barely find a place where you won’t leave me in the gutter, </em><em>where you won’t leave me bone and bloody”</em>. Check out <em>Bone And Bloody</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F32699509&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p>via <a href=\"https://www.earmilk.com/2012/01/26/day-joy-bone-and-bloody-earmilk-premiere/\" target=\"_blank\">Earmilk</a></p>\n","slug":"14466-new-day-joy-bone-and-bloody","category":"mpfree","date":1327943547000,"wpid":14466,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":444,"src":"2012/01/393807_156549541126676_132194510228846_227109_2003183288_n-950x444.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAfEAACAgICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEACEFEQYUodL/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8ApeZXbPB8MOWoTyCb2lrtDIQ8JURBwQh0G7J3v4MtpbssiktCSR3tD+sYwP/Z"},"createdAt":1587292981753,"updatedAt":1588443775993,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/01/393807_156549541126676_132194510228846_227109_2003183288_n-950x444.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
