Alright, so maybe it’s a little <em>too</em> similar to the London trio at times (<em>Mountain</em>), but come on, who wouldn’t want to sound like one of the coolest bands in the world?<strong> Evan Mullins</strong>, lead singer of <strong>Voyager</strong> also has a variety of slick covers on his soundcloud, including Bon Iver’s Flume and Lana Del Rey’s Summertime Sadness (which is fantastic), further demonstrating their inspiration drawn from crossover ‘indie’ pop acts. So it’s not an entirely new sound; from the platonic electronic drumbeats to the nostalgic guitar tone, it’s not pushing any boundaries, but damn is it good.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=89991565/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"410\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F71019260\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18832-introducing-voyager","category":"introducing","date":1356297073000,"wpid":18832,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":61,"src":"2012/12/399207_362867170478761_1942356935_n-165x61.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAEAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEE/8QAIRAAAQMDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBAMGIQcRExcjY6H/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCQ9U7pitcwS6FQbBvkotJ+LR2bcZzzR8+oIiKkf//Z"},"createdAt":1587284307344,"updatedAt":1588443771232,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/12/399207_362867170478761_1942356935_n-165x61.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
