The vocals are smooth and considered, coming in somewhere between <strong>Death Cab For Cutie</strong> and <strong>The Little Hands Of Asphalt</strong>. Yet there’s a darker tinge to <strong>Freakish Atlantic</strong>; the instrumental intro track showcasing this perfectly.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2466314003/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The folk influences stand true however, such as on <em>Esther</em>, which tells the harrowing story of a female acquaintance careering off the rails. The imagery is clear and concise; ‘<em>Daddy was a fascist, left you bruises on your knees, he took you then for granted, betrayed his daughter with the bees</em>‘, proving both brooding and deeply thoughtful. All in all, <em><strong>Siren Songs</strong></em> is an extremely promising release, combining varied inspirations with commendable songwriting; building expectation for a full length release from <strong>Freakish Atlantic</strong>. <em><strong>Siren Songs</strong></em> is available for free downlaod via their <a href=\"https://freakishatlantic.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> page.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=718958171/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"10903-introducing-freakish-atlantic","category":"introducing","date":1317069242000,"wpid":10903,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":720,"height":480,"src":"2011/09/313644_281143635232486_279533785393471_1357667_7495542_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAHRAAAgICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMAAgQFESFRMf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCJv9fo14uYrVqyA/GpS4e1pIZ9FgK8de9+TJ8GIgf/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587293762993,"updatedAt":1588403546822,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/09/313644_281143635232486_279533785393471_1357667_7495542_n.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
