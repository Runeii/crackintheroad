Today Neon Indian dropped the official video for the album cut ‘Polish Girl’. Directed by <strong><a href=\"https://timnackashi.com/\">Tim Nackashi</a></strong> and made in conjunction with <strong><a href=\"https://www.thecreatorsproject.com/\">The Creators Project</a></strong>, the video tells the inter-entity love affair of a robot and the woman he loves. It’s actually bizarrely moving, and through its art style perfectly captures the throwback style of the record.</p>\n<p>Stream the new video below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0Q_JwOqko4\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"11217-video-neon-indian-polish-girl","category":"music","date":1315942149000,"wpid":11217,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/polish-girl-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587293867752,"updatedAt":1588403548164,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/09/polish-girl-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
