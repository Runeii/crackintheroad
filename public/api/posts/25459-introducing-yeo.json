Yeo softly croons: ‘<em>Don’t you know my heart can be broken?</em>‘ It sounds less like a cathartic, forlorn plea, and more like a gentle reminder. Here, Yeo is like a mix of James Blake and Toro Y Moi, sans the desperation of the former and the occasional sonic brashness of the latter. In general, he has more than enough potential to match either in talent.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/np7eJ94gD_c\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25459-introducing-yeo","category":"introducing","date":1387200886000,"wpid":25459,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":506,"src":"2013/12/yeo.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAHhAAAgICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAIQMEBRMUQVL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//EABgRAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECABFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDCdTjdMcc2ba7T2ZCiLjIoirJ9XIFVSoPja1j4iIYpqq6+66AG/9k="},"createdAt":1587282651778,"updatedAt":1588403523233,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d23","old_image":"2013/12/yeo.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
