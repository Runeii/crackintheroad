A member of art-rock group Futurist and folk outfit The Album Lead as well as being a classically trained violinist, it’s only a matter of time before the insanely talented <strong>KYLIAN</strong> is gracing the pages of all the hottest blogs.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F103044056\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23625-new-kylian-remind-me","category":"mpfree","date":1375469572000,"wpid":23625,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":792,"height":647,"src":"2013/08/970641_494960210589562_1383151051_n.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAICAIAAABPmPnhAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABA0lEQVR4nAH4AAf/ADY3P1JTWm9wdoeHjZqan5KSl3x8gmVmbU1OVjk6QgBdXmWJio+urrPBwcZ7fIKZmZ60tLmWlpt5eX9YWWEAhYWLra2ysrK3hYaLKSszRkdOvb3BrKyxkpKYc3N4AJWVm7Kyt7+/xKChpVhZYC8wN5WVm7m5vpuboH5+hACUlJqtrbK8vMGZmZ6SkZdZWV9CQ0qqq6+VlZt7e4EAhISKmpqfq6uwgoOIdHV6enqALzA4cXJ4h4eNa2tyAGFhaHJzeYWFi3N0eUpLUk9QVzc4QGVmbWJiaVFSWgAyNDw7PUVDREs4OkEtLjUlJS4kJS08PkUwMjsrLDS/H29krjIJyAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="},"createdAt":1587283170519,"updatedAt":1588403528294,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/970641_494960210589562_1383151051_n.png","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
