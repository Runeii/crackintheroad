The aforementioned <em>Kids These Days</em> being the undoubted highlight, with it’s rousing build-up and strained vocals. Elsewhere there’s the pop inspired vulnerability of <em>Rainlake</em>, culminating in the rather wonderful lyric “<em>took a pill to feel the same, made a lake from falling rain</em>“. Comparison wise, it’s difficult to pick direct relations, with closest being the opening lines of <em>Kids These Days</em> sounding scarily like Alex Turner. Check out <em>Kids These Days</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4181624235/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14386-introducing-lips-teeth","category":"introducing","date":1327418962000,"wpid":14386,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":123,"src":"2012/01/290102_267885336566770_267884186566885_890732_417602587_o-165x123.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQH/8QAIRAAAgEDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRAAMEBRMhBhIUQWH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBP/EABkRAQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMSMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AxTp8eNbzis3MVBuNbDiJAJ55kge4qpF0xkVjpKMSJLbzCfsd9KVG5LJG0DhP/9k="},"createdAt":1587293006693,"updatedAt":1588443776255,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/01/290102_267885336566770_267884186566885_890732_417602587_o-165x123.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
