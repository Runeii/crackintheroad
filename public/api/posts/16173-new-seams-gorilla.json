Having appeared on BBC R1 last night to perform several tracks during <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00rd4wh\" target=\"_blank\">Ally McCrae’s show</a>, the Scottish outfit have released a new track <em>Gorilla</em> as a free download. With Katie’s sublime vocal and the jerky <strong>Foals</strong>-esque guitar lines, <strong>Seams</strong> have one of the finest sounds around, striving to embodying a sort of energy that’s vaguely reminiscent of<strong> Blood Red Shoes</strong>. Check out <em>Gorilla</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F44110593&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16173-new-seams-gorilla","category":"mpfree","date":1335213190000,"wpid":16173,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":109,"src":"2012/04/545092_370122956362303_141176365923631_995391_1143463541_n-165x109.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAIRAAAQMDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEBQYHIZESEyL/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECIf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ai5HdbNWds8zfwVNPvNo9aifgqITMmDHh0TWaHXmTWSo5bKSrni6WB1NKU9MNaf/Z"},"createdAt":1587292519095,"updatedAt":1588443774497,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/04/545092_370122956362303_141176365923631_995391_1143463541_n-165x109.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
