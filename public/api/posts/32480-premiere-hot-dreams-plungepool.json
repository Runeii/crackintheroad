Seemingly drawing from the likes of White Lies and Foals, it’s an intricately crafted number, building to an epic festival ready finale, hinting at extremely lofty ambitions for the four piece. Whilst it’s clearly early days, there’s more than enough here to suggest that Hot Dreams are well worth keeping a close eye on. Check out Plungepool below.</p>\n<p>Like this?
