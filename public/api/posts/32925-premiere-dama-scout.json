Their second outing, the equally as energetic <em>All In Too</em>, is another twisted behemoth of a track – as much Sleater Kinney as it is Slint at points, whilst managing to find some solid hooks amongst all the raucousness. Having recorded elements of the track on a broken laptop microphone, the coarse nature to the production is at times a stark contrast to the almost dream-pop smooth vocals, resulting in an exhilaratingly unique sound.</p>\n<p>All In Too is released 25 November. Check it out below and catch Dama Scout supporting Few Bits at the Victoria, Dalston 7 December.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/292357169%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-LiiM9&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"32925-premiere-dama-scout","category":"music","date":1478786803000,"wpid":32925,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587279968989,"updatedAt":1588442050426,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/7a9acf7d0b299de80f8bfa7572ff68103b91f1ad.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
