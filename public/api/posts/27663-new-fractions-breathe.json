Describing themselves as “a female fronted synth pop band featuring current and ex members of Lavotchkin & End Reign, as well as local producers Joey Murphy, Worry Party & RoadToCairo”, there’s definite hints of CHVRCHES, M83 and CitR favourites Ecstasy in their bold, near-athemic debut track, Breathe. Perhaps not quite as ‘clean’ as the aforementioned acts, however it’s early days, and it’s a mightily promising first outing.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/139935245&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27663-new-fractions-breathe","category":"music","date":1395968131000,"wpid":27663,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":606,"height":536,"src":"2014/03/1901240_726304240755431_1493173720_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAJAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDCP/EABwQAQACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhExITJB0f/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDLrWrWyOvcvyAXBzLW7RzUD//Z"},"createdAt":1587282288553,"updatedAt":1588403517075,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/03/1901240_726304240755431_1493173720_n.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
