If you haven’t heard Forgotten Thoughts, then head over to <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/pt/album/forgotten-thoughts/id414948139\">iTunes</a> to download the EP for a very modest amount.</p>\n<p><em>Crack in the Road: How did Dreams come about?</em></p>\n<p><strong>The  idea of Dreams born on October 2009. I came across Washed Out and Neon  Indian, and that submersed electronic lo-fi caught me. I was thinking in  performing my music as well. So I started to make some tunes  influenced, most part, by Washed Out. The other stuff came after.</strong></p>\n<p><em>CitR: What would you cite as your main influences, both musically and otherwise?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Joy Division, New Order, Portishead, The Cure, Boards of Canada, Panda Bear, bad break ups, girls, day life situations….</strong></p>\n<p><em>CitR: Your music has been described as “hypnotizing thermal waves  pulsating against soothing ocean washed pop”, how would you describe it  in your own words?</em></p>\n<p><strong>I  am so bad in that subject eheh. When I started to do this I was  thinking, just, in electronic pop. I can give that work to the critics  and fans.</strong></p>\n<p><em>CitR: What was the first record you can remember falling in love with? </em></p>\n<p><strong>Probably, The Cranberries – Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We?</strong></p>\n<p><em>CitR: Where would you like to see Dreams in a years time?</em></p>\n<p><strong>That’s a hard question. I prefer to stick to the present. For the main future I want to make the album and then we’ll see eheh.</strong></p>\n<p><em>CitR: If you could have any super power, what would it be?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Hmm…I could have the power of thinking in something and then that  stuff appears in front of me (priority to guitars and synths).</strong></p>\n<p><em>CitR: If you could record a duet with anyone (alive or dead), who would you choose?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jack White, for sure!</strong></p>\n<p>Check out Dreams at the following links!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wearedreams\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wearedreams\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dreamsdontloveyou.bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dreamsdontloveyou.blogspot.com\">Blogspot</a></p>\n<p><em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_11244048.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"4941-interview-dreams","category":"interviews","date":1299073449000,"wpid":4941,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/03/dreams-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgX/xAAhEAACAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAUhBhESIjFCUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQG/8QAHBEAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQREjLB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAdb22Pl5IcOYHUpCXaZ1ITy0fEH4Oj3VOTjNmrspQ9g9aWjsUsjc5kVnYqtjGQCdD2pHkZpBkLoCRwBK32P6aueCXWOtig6MfglqcRLVPbyf/Z"},"createdAt":1587294696867,"updatedAt":1588443779690,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/03/dreams-188x188.jpg","categories":["interviews","music"]}
