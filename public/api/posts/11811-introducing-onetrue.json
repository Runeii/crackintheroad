I can imagine parts of this EP being rapped over, whilst other sections make for elegantly enticing breakdowns. It’s repetitive in form, but not to the point of proving dull or misinformed; portrayed excellently by the stunning <em>XIVXIV</em>, composed almost entirely of a basic piano chords and a drum machine.
