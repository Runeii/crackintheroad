Well, that’s practically impossible, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Noah Wall</strong> would beg to differ, with his new record <strong><em>Héloïse</em></strong> concocted of twelve glorious songs of heartfelt purpose, all in awe of his mother <strong>Hèloïse Betts Wall</strong>. Despite their conjoined subject matter, it’s a diverse selection of tracks, all of which excel when graced with the presence of <strong>Wall’s</strong> desperately honest vocals. The six minute epic <em>Public Dancer</em> being a fantastic amalgamation of <strong>Wall’s</strong> abilities, fusing intriguing samples with stunning reverb laden effects, making for an all encompassing listening experience.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4048311087/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/track/public-dancer\">Public Dancer by Noah Wall</a></iframe></p>\n<p>Elsewhere there is the gentle yet slightly sinister rumble of <em>Mind Games</em>, allowing the track to be both stimulating and wildly twisted, as it lurches from melancholic bass sections to light electronic pulses. There’s clear new wave influences, in the lo-fi recording aesthetic and the sturdy production, however it’s <strong>Wall’s</strong> vocals that make the real connection, breathing life in <em><strong>Hèloïse</strong></em>. There are perhaps times when the record lacks clarity in the songwriting, although this as a concept may reflect the relationship between mother and son. Whilst there’s no doubting the emotional significance of a mothering figure in our lives, no true relationship is without it’s glitches and strains.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2527810743/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/track/mind-games\">Mind Games by Noah Wall</a></iframe></p>\n<p>Several listens through and the intricacies that seemed so unimportant originally, begin to creep out, such as the multi-layered<em> Snowfax</em> and the sharp edged <em>Neil’s Diamonds</em>. In creating a record centred around such a personal character, and one unbeknown to the majority of listeners, there’s the possibility of it becoming self-indulgent however <strong>Noah Wall</strong> has managed to fashion an album that is both relatable and enjoyable. Through spotless production and varied songwriting, <em><strong>Hèloïse</strong></em> marks itself as a true testament to a <strong>Wall’s</strong> ability as well as his mother-son relationship, whilst providing a telling insight into the emotions experienced by others.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hèloïse</strong></em> is available to stream and purchase via <a href=\"https://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/album/h-lo-se\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Crash Symbols</strong></a>.</p>\n","slug":"11342-review-noah-wall-heloise","category":"album-reviews","date":1316282298000,"wpid":11342,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/09/336201_270366269647891_268926993125152_1111879_5721300_o-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGB//EACMQAAECBAcBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAwAFESEEBgcSFCIxQXL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBf/EAB0RAAEEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMEEkFRgbH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AAJPqTPJFp1ycTLwLGNkLfKdMewra4fVrS6RijxzNx5w0l2ILcSlVFS9Yb5nMiy1KdxEvd71fxEMSruW6+xNqVw7KXbj52nLMQceF//Z"},"createdAt":1587293825748,"updatedAt":1588403547675,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/09/336201_270366269647891_268926993125152_1111879_5721300_o-165x165.jpg","categories":["album-reviews","music"]}
