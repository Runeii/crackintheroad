Keeping up to date with her Facebook page, she regularly posts new music that she’s discovered, the likes of FKA Twigs, Alpine and Laurel; and what’s even more interesting is hearing it translate into her own music. New track <em>Eyes Unclouded</em> is far and away her most ‘complete’ work to date, a swirling, almost Kate Bush-esque number, showing a lyrical maturity far beyond her modest years.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/127905470&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25787-new-lupa-eyes-unclouded","category":"mpfree","date":1388879481000,"wpid":25787,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":637,"height":637,"src":"2014/01/8649_155875997953964_272697006_n.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587282615891,"updatedAt":1588403522676,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/01/8649_155875997953964_272697006_n.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
