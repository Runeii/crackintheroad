Scout Larue)","content":"<p>Up until <a href=\"https://www.</p><p>gorillavsbear.net/2012/01/11/mp3-nicolas-jaar-with-just-one-glance/\" target=\"_blank\">Gorilla vs Bear</a> pointed everyone in the right direction, this new cut from <strong>Nicolas Jaar</strong> went somewhat under the radar. Featuring vocals from <strong>Scout Larue</strong>, the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, it’s seemingly picks up where <strong>Jaar</strong> left off on<strong> Darkside</strong>. Whilst the sampled vocals underneath hark back to <strong>Space Is Only Noise</strong>, the minimal, languid production points to a future, darker sound. Try telling me you aren’t falling in love.
