The Cardiff based four piece put on a real enjoyable show with some tight instrumental performances and fantastic on stage antics that came off as super fun and engaging. With that in mind I wanted to highlight their single from last year Face Behind Her Cigarette. A rhythm heavy bit of indie rock that takes some of the best elements from a sound that has somewhat diminished as the decades gone on. Think the fun parts of Foals with some of the character and happy-go-lucky atmosphere of Vulfpeck. Hoping that Boy Azooga really push on in 2018 and they can bring more of the fun of their live shows into their new releases.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F350100013&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"34131-new-boy-azooga-face-behind-her-cigarette","category":"live-reviews","date":1516295521000,"wpid":34131,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":491,"height":491,"src":"2018/01/pf03k3p2.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwQG/8QAIBAAAgICAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEhBQYAEnGBsf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEG/8QAGBEBAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAzH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMTynYbnduxRBVmFIMFr1EGW3jZGQGOQTs6/bl5FQoAt1QMaBvMuPr1OPjPh3HNItiArI4IbRDHxZ6/DFJwPGu8aM7VoiWKgkn0G/HZJABzKPXTar3P/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587279770971,"updatedAt":1588403497413,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d31","old_image":"2018/01/pf03k3p2.jpg","categories":["live-reviews","music"]}
