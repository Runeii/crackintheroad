Wanting that from the group though is somewhat missing the point. They make gorgeous, catchy and evocative indie pop. That’s their niche and that’s what they’ve done with ‘Simple And Sure’.</p>\n<p>The track is rich and beautifully layered. Upbeat and cheery, complete cooed “ohs” and “ahs” in the background, all in contrast to the darker lean of the lyrics. It’s three and a half minutes of pop purity.</p>\n<p>All hail The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart – they’re finally back.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/136713202&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27120-new-pains-pure-heart-simple-sure","category":"music","date":1393511463000,"wpid":27120,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":633,"src":"2014/02/pobpah-950x633.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIRAAAAYCAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxESBAUhBiMxMmL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBv/EAB4RAAIBAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMEEwUGERIx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDPd913jKS/rNVjpPCu6jutmVkEqW1ySvefngoKTE0nfMVK7Tl45jxIALzbaJa2xNIAdvYdRXPXbISeJ//Z"},"createdAt":1587282367933,"updatedAt":1588443765198,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"2014/02/pobpah-950x633.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
