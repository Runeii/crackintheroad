New EP <em><strong>Feelings 4 U</strong></em> is a glorious Dilla inspired throwback, instrumental hip-pop in it’s element. Released through <a href=\"https://absentfever.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Absent Fever</strong></a>, the lovechild of Eloise (<a href=\"https://verbreverb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">verb/re/verb</a>) and Tyler (<a href=\"https://flashlightag.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flashlight Tag</a>), the digital label is proving rather prolific with this being their eleventh outing in under a year.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Feelings 4 U</strong></em> embodies the swagger of UK beat maestro<strong> Star Slinger</strong>, with the soulful vibes of minimalist producer <strong>Balam Acab</strong>. <em>Our Theme Song</em> is so desirably danceable that I defy anyone to resist the urge to prance around their room like a deranged lunatic; I know I did. Title track<em> Feelings 4 U</em> is another hip-hop beauty, sampling vocals over the top of looped synths to energizing effect.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1532134356/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Where <em>Feelings 4 U</em> slips up slightly is in the variety of tracks on the release, with almost all nine cuts following a similar production formula. EP closer <em>Secret Lover</em> is perhaps the greatest deviation from the trend, with a more down-beat feel, providing an interesting contrast to the tracks before it.
