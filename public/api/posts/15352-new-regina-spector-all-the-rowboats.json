The first track to be released from her new record, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_We_Saw_From_The_Cheap_Seats\">What We Saw From The Cheap Seats</a>, </em>is a sharp powerhouse of a single and more than enough to spark my interest again. Piano based as always, it lacks that much needed quirk of early <strong>Spektor</strong>, but with song-writing this good is it even needed?</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F37731536&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15352-new-regina-spector-all-the-rowboats","category":"music","date":1330382550000,"wpid":15352,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292746750,"updatedAt":1588441780699,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2012/02/regina-spektor-950x653.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
