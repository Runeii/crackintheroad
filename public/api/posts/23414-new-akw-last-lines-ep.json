Their first official release since last years <strong><em>Silent War</em></strong> EP, <strong><em>Last Lines</em></strong> is a bolder outing, more expansive and confident in sound, but without losing the beauty possessed by their earlier releases, and much of that is down to Wisner’s stunning vocals. Whether it’s practically wailing ‘I have to figure this out on my own’ or weeping ‘there were photos on the walls / of when we were running for our lives’ over the top of a melancholic piano section (from EP standout track <em>A Better Sea</em>), <strong>AKW</strong> are primed for the big time, in the same way that CHVRCHES have been for so long. Check out<em> A Better Sea</em> and <em>Last Lines</em> below, and the full <strong><em>Last Lines</em> </strong>EP underneath that.</p>\n<p><em>i used to feel the weight of love / ‘cus i was the one to carry it all</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F102811249\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F102811316\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 659px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=183387324/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23414-new-akw-last-lines-ep","category":"music","date":1375029955000,"wpid":23414,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283212390,"updatedAt":1588441763755,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/6ff59179b2a219c101f8b84e261e1e1978beffd1.jpg","categories":["music","stream","new"]}
