Whilst it’s only their premiere outing, upon the strength of this one track, <strong>Young Limbs</strong> could well be one of the most exciting new British bands to appear this year.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=811617610/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23933-new-young-limbs-i-dont-mind","category":"mpfree","date":1376956966000,"wpid":23933,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283059441,"updatedAt":1587825865184,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
