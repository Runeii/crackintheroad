And what better way to celebrate the occasion than with this colourful little gen from Glasgow based producer, <strong><a href=\"https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/segabodega\">Sega Bodega</a></strong>. Starting off as a centred slow burner, his new track, <em>Konerak</em>, shyly erupts to form a manic and dizzying set of sounds. Definitely one to watch.</p>\n<p><strong>Sega Bodega</strong> will release his EP 34 on 1st April, via Week Of Wonders.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F79083458\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"19766-new-sega-bodega-konerak","category":"music","date":1360845186000,"wpid":19766,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":95,"src":"2013/02/segabodega-165x95.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIhAAAQMDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACBAMREhMjUQUGFDFB/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/EABgRAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAANB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDRJbYULvTpMoum6rYvj6TauyA43ywvbI+ieAFVui0Mjt/eURFyAJjndUo+b//Z"},"createdAt":1587283967795,"updatedAt":1588443769775,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2013/02/segabodega-165x95.jpg","categories":["music","new","newnews"]}
