Thankfully, the first recorded track from the quintet, <em>Default</em>, made available on iTunes yesterday, is all we could ever hope for, and so much more. Mixing <strong>Yorke’s</strong> recent obsession with choppy melodies and dub-percussion sections with the immaculate production of <strong>Godrich</strong>, it’s far superior to anything from <strong>Radiohead’s</strong> most recent LP.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yxWBd840E9g\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17831-new-atoms-for-peace-default","category":"music","date":1347013807000,"wpid":17831,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":559,"src":"2012/09/201007121949095140.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHxAAAQMFAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFBhExEiFB/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREC/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDNsVyJUGQW3YrLsQJAJ3pST9PPdRtxurLlwlLS0PFTqiO82aUpSayqf//Z"},"createdAt":1587284742538,"updatedAt":1588403536881,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2012/09/201007121949095140.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
