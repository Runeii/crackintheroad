Almost gleeful sounding, it’s insincere in an Ariel Pink, Mac DeMarco manner, and you know what, it’s bloody fantastic. Check out both tracks below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F85093052\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F85092273\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20595-new-los-porcos-do-you-wanna-live-jesus-luvs-u-baby","category":"music","date":1364391749000,"wpid":20595,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283717384,"updatedAt":1588441767777,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273272542a08e42c4a99d386637.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
