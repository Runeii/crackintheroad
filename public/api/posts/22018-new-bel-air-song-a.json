So the home recording leaves the vocals slightly rough at times, but it’s all the more haunting, especially when coupled with the lyrics <em>‘I was never told my name, but what does it even say?</em>‘. One of the finest debut tracks of 2013.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4194063831/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22018-new-bel-air-song-a","category":"mpfree","date":1369076273000,"wpid":22018,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":960,"height":800,"src":"2013/05/428427_382563938524855_157768505_n-960x800.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIhAAAQMDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEEgYTIRQxMkGR/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMEsWdOItrXrHUi4U2MkIJVBJE5HxHHyTNTLybTdXsuu7eRxyQJj1PPelKD/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283481375,"updatedAt":1588403530052,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/05/428427_382563938524855_157768505_n-960x800.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
