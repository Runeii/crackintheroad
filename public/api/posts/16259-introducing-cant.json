Eighteen year old Chicago producer <del><strong>CAN’T</strong></del><strong> Wih’lo </strong> may well find his name being tossed around amongst those previously mentioned, especially off the back of his debut EP <strong><em>Wasted</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Mastering a similar glistening texture to the likes of<strong> Beat Culture</strong> and<strong> xxyyxx</strong>, <strong>CAN’T</strong> centers all four of the tracks around an individual vocal section – “<em>Why can’t we? Bring your body.</em>” (<em>Bring Your</em>) and “<em>I just want the one that makes you happy.</em>” (<em>One That Makes You Happy</em>). It’s the atmospheric density that allow the tracks to gain a semblance of uniqueness, relying upon repetitive loops and sparkling synths to elevate them beyond the level of ‘just another bedroom producer’. Whilst it’s still early days for <strong>Wih-lo</strong>, this debut EP is one of the most promising releases I’ve heard this year thus far.
