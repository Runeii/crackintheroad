While the UK has <strong>Summer Camp</strong> fronted by <strong>Jeremy Warmsley</strong> and his partner <strong>Elizabeth Sankey</strong>, over in Denver Colorado the US have husband and wife duo <strong>Tennis</strong>.<strong> Tennis</strong> comprise ofÂ <strong>Patrick Riley</strong> and <strong>Alaina Moore</strong> and make similar lilting swoon some indie pop. The lo-fi production is evident as the music crackles and scratches against the sweet vocals of <strong>Moore</strong> but this specific track <em>Marathon</em> is really quite glorious coming across like <strong>The Supremes </strong>crossed with<strong> The Vivian Girls</strong>. Not too much is known about this duo and not too much music is available yet but they certainly show great potential.<br />\nClearly in 2010 the unfashionable virtue of monogamy is very much in evidence in terms of making great music, judging by the sound of <strong>Tennis</strong> this is entirely a good thing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.sendspace.com/file/gvh1ct\">Download Marathon</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/tennisinc\">Check Out Their Myspace</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://underwaterpeoples.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=78&Itemid=92\">Buy Marathon</a></p>\n","slug":"1437-introducing-tennis","category":"music","date":1276635606000,"wpid":1437,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":450,"src":"2011/06/tennis.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAIhAAAAQEBwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECBAMRISIFBhIWMVGS/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAX/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhP/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMtvnjDrlREuNSlHK0qFSXBi+/GPcfwQAHpmtP/Z"},"createdAt":1587295190927,"updatedAt":1588403566546,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d33","old_image":"2011/06/tennis.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
