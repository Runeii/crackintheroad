Whilst I didn’t have time then to put anything in words on the four piece rap collective comprised of <strong>Tecs</strong>, <strong>Sony</strong>,<strong> 2EZ</strong> and <strong>I.D.</strong>, I bookmarked their music for future reference, and boy am I glad I did. These two new tracks from <strong>Tecs</strong> and <strong>2EZ</strong> are their slickest outings to date, perfecting the underground trap sound whilst showcasing the lyrical proficiency of both artists. There’s whiffs of early 90’s NY, most notably <strong> Organized Konfusion</strong>, mainly through the crescendo’s of each verse and intelligent production values. Check out <em>Sapphire Oceans</em> and <em>Alcatrazphronies</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F52122168&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F51841312&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17231-new-gospels-sapphire-oceans-alcatrazphronies-tecs-2ez","category":"music","date":1341772882000,"wpid":17231,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284959780,"updatedAt":1588441775912,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273f04129560646f61b5d921686.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
