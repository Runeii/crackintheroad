Well the Philadelphia duo are back for more, with the sumptuous <em>Catch Me</em>. Imagine an innocent, fledgling <strong>My Bloody Valentine</strong> jacked up on a whole Halloween’s worth of candy, and you begin to understand the general atmosphere of <em>Catch Me</em>. Synths swirl majestically whilst vocals from <strong>Dani</strong> float effortlessly over the top in such a youthful manner that it’s impossible to not be completely seduced.<strong> Lockets</strong> are truly blossoming into one of 2012’s finest new bands. Check out the video below, featuring footage from 1998’s <em><strong>Bullet Ballet</strong></em> directed by <strong>Shinya Tsukamoto</strong> and starring <strong>Kirina Mano</strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/35126798?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/35126798\">Lockets – Catch Me</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/lockets\">Lockets</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n","slug":"14299-video-lockets-catch-me","category":"mpfree","date":1327006212000,"wpid":14299,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293040722,"updatedAt":1588441783419,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/61ce1d3665ad27a44119925aa64bd09d9858ae4b.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
