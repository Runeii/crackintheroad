{"id":"5e9bf79e8fb2d30d7769c75f","title":"Introducing: bülow","content":"<p>Released at the tail end of last year with relatively little fanfare, the debut EP from seventeen year old Dutch pop powerhouse in waiting <strong>bülow</strong> has become one of the most buzzy projects of recent times, not least for the brilliance of lead single, <em>Not A Love Song</em>, which has clocked up four and half million streams on Spotify already.</p><p> Merging elements of Lorde and Sigrid, there’s a real youthful and playfulness to the EP that makes it so deliriously addictive. Check out Not A Love Song below, alongside the new video for another EP track, <em>Lines</em>. Try telling me this isn’t the true sound of 2018.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OsrylSTDvAw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/baQwsjloI4s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"34104-introducing-bulow","category":"introducing","date":1515595484000,"wpid":34104,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":2048,"height":1286,"src":"2018/01/unnamed-13.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQF/8QAIRAAAgEDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABEhBRIVBCIyUYH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABsRAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMSIVGR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCHTuQOlTPLPHJI6hdzC5QYuFNsX+1m8l1adrbXYYLEi5PvxpSqvbcTSQjKjk//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587279774991,"updatedAt":1588403497603,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2018/01/unnamed-13.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
