It’s gloriously upbeat, kind of like a-ha brought into the 21st century and embodying the spirit of a angsty, lovelorn,<strong> New Order</strong> listening teenager. Grab a free download of <em>Breaker</em> below, and keep your ears peeled for a new EP in 2012.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=469948395/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13081-new-yung-life-breaker","category":"mpfree","date":1323813430000,"wpid":13081,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293265834,"updatedAt":1588441785053,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ccf32959cce71278d3279055d588dc19e2727058.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
