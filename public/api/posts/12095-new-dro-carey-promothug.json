Something about the bass/kickdrum combination that makes me want to scream “instant classic”. But it’s still weird enough for those not familiar with <strong>Dro Carey</strong> to scream “what the fuck is this?”</p>\n<p>The truth is, his music can’t be pigeonholed whatsoever. There’s so much going on, it’s not even about genres anymore. You can often dissect these recent producers’ output by the structures and sounds used, but <strong>Dro Carey</strong> is a jammy one, wriggling out of genre confinements and spreading his mongrel seed. Makes sense that he’s previously teamed up with everyone from <strong>Will Bankhead</strong> to <strong>Trim</strong>. And his music just keeps growing and growing. The new <strong>Dro Carey</strong> release is on <strong>RAMP Recordings</strong> and is called <strong><em>Journey With The Heavy</em></strong>, out on 5th December on 2×12″ and download.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to Promothug below.</em></p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26369575&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26369575&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object></p>\n","slug":"12095-new-dro-carey-promothug","category":"music","date":1319653773000,"wpid":12095,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":110,"src":"2011/10/drocarey-165x110.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAdEAACAgMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgARAwQFEyFh/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAREjFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCz0trprtprczx4NRUt8xNsfgEqJ0VCKGyMWr2aqzEQA7LZ8lC1qf/Z"},"createdAt":1587293623189,"updatedAt":1588403545690,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2011/10/drocarey-165x110.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
