I’m unsure as to what else I could possibly say to convey the sheer of beauty of this track, check out <em>Lost At Last</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2134688204/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"13744-mpfree-beaufields-lost-at-last-live-from-st-stephens-church-artarmon1","category":"introducing","date":1326394394000,"wpid":13744,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293114769,"updatedAt":1587825906553,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
