RZA is the executive producer on the album while Adrian Younge is providing the beats. You can listen to and download ‘The Sure Shot [Parts 1 And 2]’ below and grab the full release on the 16th April. <iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2444557878/size=grande/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" height=\"100\" width=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"20270-mpfree-ghostface-killah-adrian-younge-the-sure-shot-parts-1-and-2","category":"mpfree","date":1362564554000,"wpid":20270,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283822137,"updatedAt":1588441769130,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"generated/5d214773f948fd823e73d6c80bf968cde2e4b6b9.jpg","categories":["mpfree","newmpfree","new","music","newnews"]}
