Having spent the formative years of <strong>The 1975 </strong>showcasing their music in similar scenarios, in this instance a talent contest in a room full of stern-looking pensioners, it’s slightly tongue in cheek, suggesting that whilst the fame, the sales and the world-wide tours may have changed, they’re still very much the same band who penned now chart-topping songs in cramped bedrooms and rehearsal rooms. Check out Heart Out below, directed by Matthew Healy and Adam Powell.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/t9xA1Lvd37E?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29745-video-1975-heart","category":"music","date":1410187000000,"wpid":29745,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1280,"height":800,"src":"2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-08-at-17.30.26-1280x800.png","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAwklEQVR4nGMIjkkMiEpOru4un7exff3B3i1H2zcezpuwODQ5PyQulcEvLMrRwy80rzata27L6j1T911oXbs/qrTVwd3HJySCwc3H18bVp3zG8qq56yZuPzZ558mEqs7gjBIHdy93bx8GTS0tNU0dU2t7MxsHW3cfK2d3LV1DTR0DDU0tLU0NBiVFRUUFRXlZWQU5WR09Q11DYwV5OXlZWRVlRSVFBQYVZWVFBQVlFVVVVTXv2Ayv2AwlJbCIkpKqijIALN051xe/hPIAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"createdAt":1587281921902,"updatedAt":1588403515417,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-08-at-17.30.26-1280x800.png","categories":["music","videos"]}
