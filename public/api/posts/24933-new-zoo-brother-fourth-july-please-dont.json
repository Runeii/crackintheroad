Fourth of July comes with the equally as addictive b-side, <em>Please Don’t</em>, centred around yet another killer hook. Check out both tracks below, as well as the fantastic artwork above.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/119881104\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/119880812\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"24933-new-zoo-brother-fourth-july-please-dont","category":"mpfree","date":1384696268000,"wpid":24933,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":900,"height":900,"src":"2013/11/a2557960192_10.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgQF/8QAIhAAAgICAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAURABITITEGFGGB/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwX/xAAZEQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQISIRH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANa6+Ub5NfjjzOQhxtuf60crlu2mm6n6R7B1sfuuMsbjJFx1ULnWlAiQCQs4L+B5/vL1oU58ra71WvJqSRh1xg6O/friqGnVSJFStCqhQAAgAA5Pt0Z1cFmn/9k="},"createdAt":1587282771076,"updatedAt":1588403524902,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/11/a2557960192_10.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
