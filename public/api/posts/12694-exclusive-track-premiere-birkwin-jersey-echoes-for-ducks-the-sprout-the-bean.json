Their delicate and soulful layering of strings amongst a backdrop of sporadic sampling and joyously freeform beats, have created something unexpectedly different in the climate of folk music.</p>\n<p><strong>Birkwin Jersey</strong> make folk music, but rather than making music best suited for a country pub, they instead enforce an adventurous and spontaneous energy that could perhaps be the back drop to chase scene upon a mist soaked vista. Their new track, released on our firm friend’s label <strong><a href=\"https://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/\">Housewarming Records</a></strong>, is a flamenco driven assault that left me spinning and breathless. As with a lot of their work a sense of narrative is clear, the track descends and ascends with a conscious level of fluidity, yet still manages to surprise on every level.</p>\n<p>Despite the a-side ‘<strong><em>Echos for ducks</em></strong>’ being a strong track, in actual fact the single’s b-side, a cover of <strong>Joanna Newsom</strong>’s ‘<strong><em>The Sprout & The Bean</em></strong>‘, is the star of the show. Here the bands’ experimental attitude to folk production is harnessed in a track with songwriting more firmly on its sleeve. If this direction is more closely pursued by <strong>Birkwin Jersey</strong>, we could have something even more exciting on our hands.</p>\n<p>Stream the new single below.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2176451669/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12694-exclusive-track-premiere-birkwin-jersey-echoes-for-ducks-the-sprout-the-bean","category":"music","date":1321719803000,"wpid":12694,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293433000,"updatedAt":1588441785985,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/8511406554e9f506581516ad08bbdc3b4e815afd.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
