It’s in your face, it’s bold, it’s completely unashamed in it’s commercial nature, and, above all, Letters To Lions are bloody brilliant.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 560px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=43565325/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"25630-introducing-letters-lions","category":"introducing","date":1387467087000,"wpid":25630,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":633,"src":"2013/12/7863_547230431990032_1687672716_n-950x633.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHhAAAgIBBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAwQFERIxgSH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDLtH1u5cewPY6rj1AKoPf3Y+7M58k7ZcDYx49kxEMPH//Z"},"createdAt":1587282633306,"updatedAt":1588443765380,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/12/7863_547230431990032_1687672716_n-950x633.jpg","categories":["introducing","mpfree","new","music"]}
