Her debut track, <em>Old Age</em>, just feels like it deserves to be blasted out at festivals all round the world. With a hook that CHVRCHES would kill for, and like Foxes but with more angst and personality, I’m on my tenth listen and head over heels in love. Check out <em>Old Age</em> below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/139538908&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27587-new-east-old-age","category":"music","date":1395697033000,"wpid":27587,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282306456,"updatedAt":1588441759629,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/766c6e1e9b9c971e82da95f3fd2cb73347848a2d.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
