Breathy M83 style vocals, and <strong>CHVRCHES</strong>-esque synth sections building to an epic, dream-your-heart-out crescendo; from Wilkie’s Facebook posts, there’s an underlying feeling that she perhaps doesn’t appreciate simply how good this track is. Whilst it may only be a first step forward, and an at times hesitant one at that, there’s more than enough here to suggest that Ocean Calling is a name well worth keeping an eye out for in 2014.
