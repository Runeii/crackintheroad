Their debut single <em>Not So Frightening</em> is an intense vaguely <strong>Purity Ring</strong> meets<strong> Ellie Goulding</strong> style jam, that’s dark in lyrical content yet upbeat and accesible in sound. Amidst the shouts of ‘hey’, heavy synths lines and a piano riff ripped straight from a horror flick, there lies ones of the most intriguing compositions of recent times.
