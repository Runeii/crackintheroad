Not only that, but the duo comprised of <strong>Wesley Akinfolarin</strong> and <strong>Joe William Todd</strong> also brought in some of their (and as it happens also my) favourite producers to try their hand at reworking the EP cuts. Featuring the likes of <strong>Sina.</strong>, <strong>Module Module</strong> and <strong>Sun Glitters</strong>, each remix is wonderfully crafted, with the respective artists stamping their own authority on the tracks. Check out the full release below (Sina’s reworking of Sleepyhead is my personal favourite).</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2180066&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"17156-new-patterns-in-plastic-balloons-dont-always-fly-remixes","category":"music","date":1341321817000,"wpid":17156,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284989100,"updatedAt":1587825890553,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","remixes","new"]}
