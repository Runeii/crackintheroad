(You Know You’re From There)","content":"<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://godsgreenhair.</p><p>tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Courtney Denk</a></p>\n<p>Well this is rather special. Buffalo’s <strong>Space Cubs</strong> aka Suzanne Bonifacio released a trio of tracks throughout last year, all glitchy, slightly lo-fi freak-pop jaunts, thriving upon their raw production elements, and her unique vocals. Now, six months down the line and Bonifacio is back with a double AA single of sorts, the stunning<em> Why Are You Resisting? (You Know You’re From There)</em> and the equally as complex <em>Midtime Disguise</em>. Opening as a rather unsettling, Bjork meets Grimes, atmospheric number, <em>Why Are You</em>… then blossoms elegantly into a wonderfully self-assured, dream-pop gem, complete with a vaguely XX drum section (wait for 2.30ish… trust me).</p>\n<p>‘<em>You, you held your calm, while I was on the line, all dishevelled, just like yesterday’</em></p>\n<p>Check out <em>Why Are You Resisting? (You Know You’re From There) </em>below, and if that floats your boat, then try out <em>Midtime Disguise</em> underneath that.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F97750993\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F97754386\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"22709-new-space-cubs-why-are-you-resisting-you-know-youre-from-there","category":"mpfree","date":1371849253000,"wpid":22709,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283354771,"updatedAt":1588441765018,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/b679e2b9ebd675090ae14fccf036a98913937352.jpg","categories":["mpfree","new","music"]}
