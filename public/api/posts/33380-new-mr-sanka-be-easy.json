The song opens with seemingly dour synth patches and handclap percussion supporting the vocals and lyrics discussion of trying to keep positive in tough times. As the booming drum machine kick in the layered vocals start to brighten the tone of the song building the verse up towards a euphoric chorus. The tension of the verse and the release of the chorus keeps Be Easy incredibly refreshing and creates the “light at the end of the tunnel” optimism of the track.
