Also to look forward to for <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Japandroids</span> fans is the release of <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">No Singles</span>, a collection of all their previous songs not featured on last years <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Post-Nothing</span>. (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Art Czars</span> will not feature on the compilation).</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Art Czars </span>begins frantically, with stop start drums and guitar opening the track, before they get back into a similar rhythm experienced on last years album. The raw guitar sound is perfect backing for their emotional lyrics, which tell the story of a breakdown in a relationship, in which the singer recalls “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">here’s your money back, here’s your punk rock back</span>“. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Art Czars</span>is a fantastic indication of the potential that this band have, and hopefully will act as a stepping stone for greater work.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://japandroids.com/\">Official Website</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?tljmwzjull0\">Download Art Czars</a></div>\n","slug":"16-japandroids","category":"music","date":1270547100000,"wpid":16,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":292,"height":50,"src":"2011/06/japandroids1-292x50.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAACAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEH/8QAIRAAAgIBAwUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBQAEESETNEFCUVL/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE/8QAHBEAAQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAzEyQXHw/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwC1Gpeyh1i2PbOCY1hVGUyQs9OR3iPHJJ4+5iN5qHC7sNnM7hnsf0cYwkNzuwgiWjdH/9k="},"createdAt":1587295385698,"updatedAt":1588403569434,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/japandroids1-292x50.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
