Echoing the piano swells found in Rufus Wainwright’s take on the classic ‘Hallelujah’, Vargen has crafted a simple yet beautiful track that speaks directly to the listener and retains their attention throughout the two minute, twenty four seconds duration.</p>\n<p>By opening her account with a track that hangs on the bare bones of instrumentation, Vargen has not only allowed herself the space to develop her sound, she has also allowed her very promising vocal talent to be established without question.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/186776234&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"30691-introducing-lilla-vargen","category":"introducing","date":1421690502000,"wpid":30691,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":5760,"height":3840,"src":"2015/01/lilla-vargen-large.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAHRAAAgICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBAARBRITMf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDILCeLXx1quoyszQlbLDpK6isPQDYG9zJBA0MgWFQZIdJfTjGFe6r/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587281704886,"updatedAt":1588403511856,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"2015/01/lilla-vargen-large.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
