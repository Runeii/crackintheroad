Amidst the despair and desperation, there’s an underlying feeling that <strong>Phoria</strong> truly have a story to tell, and I’m more than eager to hear it.” – Josh Dalton</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84756284\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>+</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charlotte Cousins</strong></p>\n<p>I bet you didn’t know our very own art writer Charlie also makes films! Focusing on personal memory through different object and subjects. The fragility and sentimentality portrayed through Charlie’s work makes you want a piece of your very own to take care of in one of those special wooden boxes that houses all your precious keepsakes.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/59394546\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"opacity1\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>PALE</strong></p>\n<p><em>“Pale’s new song ‘Two Wrongs’ ties together this synthesis of direct opposite ends of the spectrum segueing into one harmonised piece. Another work of unrestrained, emotion-heavy synth-pop, it’s harsh on the heart but gorgeous on the ears.” – This Is Fake DIY</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F87968701\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>+</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Will Kendrick</strong></p>\n<p>If you were at CitR Live last month, you would have seen Will Kendrick as a part of art collective MadeScapes. Following slightly with the same ethos, Will’s personal practice is between an obsession of light, colour, and glitch imagery. Initially exploring the boundaries of painting, Will’s practice is contributing massively to the conversation of art’s progression toward the digital aesthetic.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZ-Ce63Vsdg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Funk Ethics</strong></p>\n<p><em>Obsession is a sonically graceful lullaby turned perverse lust for a controlling obsession. Agerskow’s vocals are pitch-perfect, yet are aimed so freely they land in the most sporadically beautiful of ways. Just close enough to being apathetic to hint at something unhinged and psychotic. – Joel Chima</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F62899465\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>+</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Joe Evans</strong></p>\n<p>Bristol based Joe Evans kaleidoscopic music visuals entrance you in the same way as, well…Kaleidoscopes.
