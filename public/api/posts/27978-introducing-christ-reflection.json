I do not hold a valid driving license, and I’m not high, so it’s hard. Their <em><strong>Journey to Realville</strong></em><strong> </strong>is the impossible combustion of blast-off (<em>i</em>), righteous full-steam cruise (<em>ii</em>), the click of jets warming down (<em>iii</em>). Edge-of-oblivion stuff, propelled screaming into the future with all the Atlas-borne weight of its heritage. Bass is dialed in white-hot while vocals are kept to a minimum, guitars drift and burst in clouds of screaming shrapnel. You’ll know who <em><strong>Journey to Realville </strong></em> sounds like, without ever knowing who it reminds you of. It is, in short, real, <em>real </em>good shit.</p>\n","slug":"27978-introducing-christ-reflection","category":"introducing","date":1397817503000,"wpid":27978,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282202509,"updatedAt":1588441758375,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d3c","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273fe0b97b9c650fc36c9550b9a.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
