{"id":"5e9c00f4774c2610387e46ff","title":"New: Camden Cox – Disguise","content":"<p> </p>\n<p>London’s own Camden Cox releases a bit of electronic perfection titled “Disguise.</p><p>” The track reads like a mellowed out redux of the dubstep era that permeated electronic music not too long ago. Those that remember Jakwob’s remix of Ellie Goulding’s Starry Eyed will be pleasantly satisfied with the similar vocal stutters that we all fell in love with as the “oh oh’s” took us to new places. Also a strong vocal similarity to my favorite Aluna of Aluna George. I’ve made plenty of throwback references, but Disguise is refreshingly new.</p>\n","slug":"28166-new-camden-cox-disguise","category":"new","date":1398864598000,"wpid":28166,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282164915,"updatedAt":1588441790522,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"generated/d5862d9b71ca157365ee09953a4bf09d43cf6599.jpg","categories":["new"]}
