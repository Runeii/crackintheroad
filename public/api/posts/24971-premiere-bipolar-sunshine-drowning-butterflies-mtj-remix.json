MTJ quickens the tempo, layers the synths and distorts the vocals to create a club ready track that still maintains all the bits that make Bipolar Sunshine so damn good. Think shiny synths, wobbling base, and, aptly, sunshiny melodies. I dare say its impossible not to groove to this.</p>\n<p>Bipolar Sunshine will be bringing some much needed light to London tonight as he headlines a show at Electrowerkz where I’m expecting to shake away the Wednesday slump!</p>\n<p>Electrowerkz tickets <a href=\"https://www.stargreen.com/bipolar-sunshine-9999.html\">here</a> (if there’s any left)</p>\n<p>Download Drowning Butterflies <a href=\"https://bipo.la/DrowningButterfliesSC\">here</a></p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120900148?secret_token=s-ZX2JI” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"24971-premiere-bipolar-sunshine-drowning-butterflies-mtj-remix","category":"music","date":1384951720000,"wpid":24971,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282758940,"updatedAt":1588441761057,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"generated/f0dc62bdb5ed26e450c8f8affb5e4dc663bdf53c.jpg","categories":["music","remixes"]}
