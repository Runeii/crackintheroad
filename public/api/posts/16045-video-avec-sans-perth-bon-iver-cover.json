Well, I guess once someone releases a eurodance styled cover of one of your tracks it’s a pretty sound indication that you’re almost there.</p><p> This cover of <em>Perth</em> from London duo <strong>Avec Sans</strong> is quirky to say the least, replacing the subtle acoustic guitar of <strong>Bon Iver</strong> with booming synths, rendering the track almost completely unrecognizable.

Probably not, but I’d almost certainly (awkwardly) dance to it.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wcRcJ3AziQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","slug":"16045-video-avec-sans-perth-bon-iver-cover","category":"music","date":1334422332000,"wpid":16045,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292558139,"updatedAt":1588441779213,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/a1d77dd9733a4d68297b45dd53a9f144a0c9e9a6.jpg","categories":["music","new","videos"]}
