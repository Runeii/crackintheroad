Earlier today the band released this statement.</p>\n<h3>So anyway… Interscope offered us a bunch of money again to release our new album TEN$ION.</h3>\n<h3>But this time, they also tried to get involved with our music, to try and make us sound like everyone else out there at the moment.</h3>\n<h3>So we said: ‘U know what, rather hang on to your money, buy yourself something nice…we gonna do our own thing. Bye bye’</h3>\n<p>It appears that <strong>Die Antwoord</strong> isn’t going to be toned down lightly. The 2 videos that followed the announcement cemented this even further, a cut called “<em>FOK JULLE NAAIERS</em>“, a track from their now self-released album <em><strong>TEN$ION</strong>. </em>Stream the videos below and download the new track <a href=\"https://zefshop.com/digital-products/die-antwoord-fok-julle-naaiers/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/31730747?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/31741727?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"12313-news-die-antwoord-release-new-track-split-with-interscope","category":"music","date":1320703342000,"wpid":12313,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293547953,"updatedAt":1588441787242,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/c9c4ba034a622e3828111372c3b5e80d991e3f3f.jpg","categories":["music","news","new","videos"]}
