The creatures slip cleverly in and out of context, embodying romanticism and monstrosity- a primeval otherness in their origins as sea creatures. Projected onto a suspended circular screen, alone in the space- they are like the last two dishevelled monsters on the dance floor at the end of the night. Embracing, collapsed on each other, the music has stopped, and all that remains are cheesy lights and the creak of floorboards.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBDfF2BFC8I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>See Sophie’s other work on her <a href=\"https://www.sophieblagden.com/\">site</a>. Including: ‘Nose Kite’- a gigantic sagging nose, trapped, revolving in a stair well, threatening to take you out on your way up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/arts/22408-artist-profile-sophie-blagden/attachment/nose-kite/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-22411\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22411\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/06/Nose-Kite.jpg\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Nose-Kite.jpg 1280w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Nose-Kite-274x300.jpg 274w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Nose-Kite-934x1024.jpg 934w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/06/Nose-Kite-46x50.jpg 46w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And ‘War Fish’- a marker penned extract from a conversation with a nine-year-old, in which memory and make-believe are confused with the smell and feel of places and objects: “(..the war fish) tastes like the Imperial War Museum, we went into an Anderson Shelter and it was very disgusting.
