The Belgium group of producers/film makers have been putting out short cryptic films in the lead up to their new EP, <strong><em>Translations</em></strong>. Now the EP has dropped, the level of obscurity seems apt. The record is hard to define, yet rather than being annoyingly unobtainable in terms of understanding; it plays with well-known and loved sounds and samples. The record, largely made up of well popular Rn’B and Hip-Hop samples, plays with these sounds and textures to great effect. It creates a cloud of mystery around records from the likes of <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> and <strong>Beyonce</strong>, jolting them into a new dimension entirely.</p>\n<p>Steam the record, which is out now on <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MushRecords\">Mush Records</a></strong>, below.</p>\n<p><object id=\"TSPlayer\" width=\"340\" height=\"410\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"sameDomain\" /><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"playlistfile=https://www.mushrecords.com/playlists/playlist.php?REAID=204&configurationfile=https://www.mushrecords.com/SECURE-TSPlayer/player-html/configuration.xml\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://www.mushrecords.com/SECURE-TSPlayer/SECURE-TSPlayerV4.5.swf\" /><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"playlistfile=https://www.mushrecords.com/playlists/playlist.php?REAID=204&configurationfile=https://www.mushrecords.com/SECURE-TSPlayer/player-html/configuration.xml\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"sameDomain\" /><param name=\"pluginspage\" value=\"https://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" /><embed id=\"TSPlayer\" width=\"340\" height=\"410\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://www.mushrecords.com/SECURE-TSPlayer/SECURE-TSPlayerV4.5.swf\" allowScriptAccess=\"sameDomain\" quality=\"high\" FlashVars=\"playlistfile=https://www.mushrecords.com/playlists/playlist.php?REAID=204&configurationfile=https://www.mushrecords.com/SECURE-TSPlayer/player-html/configuration.xml\" flashvars=\"playlistfile=https://www.mushrecords.com/playlists/playlist.php?REAID=204&configurationfile=https://www.mushrecords.com/SECURE-TSPlayer/player-html/configuration.xml\" allowscriptaccess=\"sameDomain\" pluginspage=\"https://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" /></object></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/18835641?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&autoplay=1\" width=\"398\" height=\"224\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/19586649?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/19586649\">Jealov – Teasing ‘Translations’ 2</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user5202387\">jealov</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n","slug":"10378-new-jealov-translations-ep","category":"music","date":1314010418000,"wpid":10378,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":800,"height":517,"src":"2011/08/translationscitr.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYH/8QAIRAAAQMEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQFERIGISIxUWH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF/8QAGhEAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIABBEDMf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AmL5z+8Xg1ElI2CGBk72OZKNiRhvjHpZpUXGsM8h3YO49MfURE1OKKDgjFljvs//Z"},"createdAt":1587294014564,"updatedAt":1588403550010,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/08/translationscitr.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
