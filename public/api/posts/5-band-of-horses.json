As always, Bridwell’s voice is fantastic, however it is not quite up to the high standard they set on <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Everything All The Time</span> and <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Cease To Begin</span>, and after listening to it I couldn’t help feeling that the song finishes just as it starts to get going. I still have high expectations for the album, entitled Infinite Arms released May 18th.</div>\n<p>Compliments is avaliable as a free download by signing up to the Band Of Horses mailing list at <a href=\"https://bandofhorses.com/\">https://bandofhorses.com/</a></p>\n</div>\n","slug":"5-band-of-horses","category":"music","date":1270158300000,"wpid":5,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587295401607,"updatedAt":1587825940063,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["music","reviews"]}
