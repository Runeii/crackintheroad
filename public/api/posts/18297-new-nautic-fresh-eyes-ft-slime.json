Slime)","content":"<p>Photo by <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.</p><p>flickr.com/photos/federicokenis/\" target=\"_blank\">Kenis Federico</a></em></strong></p>\n<p>There are three types of collaboration in this world, ones that make sense, ones that don’t and ones that come out of nowhere. <strong>Nautic</strong> falls into the latter category, or maybe the first, fuck it maybe even both, evidently that theory didn’t work. But anyway, the 3-piece is made up of <strong>Bullion</strong>, <strong>Laura Groves</strong> (who used to make folk-pop as <strong>Blue Roses</strong>) and <strong>Tic</strong> of the Young Turks label, with their debut track also featuring the rather naughty saxophone tones of the ever dear to our hearts, <strong>Slime</strong>. In the simplest terms, ‘<em>Fresh Eyes</em>’ is an extremely promising piece of material. It never truly feels like a finished sound, but as a statement of intent it makes the process behind the making the track seem effortless, almost inevitable.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F66487306&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"18297-new-nautic-fresh-eyes-ft-slime","category":"music","date":1352460000000,"wpid":18297,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587284515680,"updatedAt":1588441773804,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"generated/30d9cf95e2cb6a7b291596bee02ca0cb5e012256.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
