With <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sigur Rós</span> being one of my favourite bands of all time, I had extremely high expectations for this album. Last years <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Riceboy Sleeps</span>, an instrumental collaboration with boyfriend Alex Somers was more minimalistic than <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sigur Rós</span>, however, Go sees Jónsi adopt a more outwardly melodic pop sound. After giving away album track <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Boy Lilikoi </span>as a free download towards the end of 2009, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Go </span>has been one of the most eagerly anticipated album releases of the year. Whilst the album is by no means poor, there is nothing else on the album to the same standard as the inspirational <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Boy Lilikoi,</span> however I would love to witness a performance of <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Go</span> live, in which I believe the songs would take on a whole new form. Listening back to the album again, I would love to see <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jónsi</span> take on the idea of <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Boy Lilikoi</span> as a persona and for it to be included in his performances, much like <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bowie’s Thin White Duke</span>. The album is certainly far from the beauty of some of <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sigur Rós</span>‘s earlier work, and after a full listen, it leaves you rather disappointed at it’s lack of depth, but hopeful for further inspired beautiful work from <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jónsi</span>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Go-Jonsi/dp/B0037M5WVU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1270492170&sr=8-1\">Buy CD from Amazon</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?zzdniymyznt\">Boy Lilikoi</a></p>\n</div>\n","slug":"13-jonsi","category":"music","date":1270405560000,"wpid":13,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/06/jonsi-press-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgUI/8QAIBABAAEDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxETITEFBhRBYf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AM32bfT3tic5TtedquI4dRMGPeCO79UKiU8pBB2eaLy1IP/Z"},"createdAt":1587295387891,"updatedAt":1588403569459,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/jonsi-press-188x188.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
