Gambino adopts a vocal style comparable with Bilal whilst also adding a minimal and tasteful use of autotune. The instrumentation has an eerie air to it whilst also managing to balance the more sultry vibe that the rest of “Awaken, My Love!” carries through it. A clean, smooth drum pattern lays the groundwork for gorgeous hushed background vocals with numerous modulated instruments including synths and guitars riding underneath Gambino’s vocals . Zombies, amongst other tracks like lead singles Me and Your Mama and Redbone, prove Gambino as capable of tackling what has become such a popular and fast developing sound in 2016 as the likes of leaders of the genre like Anderson .Paak.
