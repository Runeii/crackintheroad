They’ve created genre-melding music that has influences of indie-rock, folk, glam and alternative and it works really well. I particularly love the way they use a female voice to round out and harmonize Django’s lead vocals, which gives it that folksy feel. And particularly in <em>Blackbird Smile</em><em>, </em>they do an excellent job of keeping the listener surprised and on his toes by changing up the different styles of music, and they all flow into each other smoothly and it makes the song that much more dynamic. And where <em>Blackbird Smile</em> is rowdy and energetic, <em>Simple</em> portrays the band’s ability for a slower and soulful sound. <em>Simple</em><em> </em>once again has great harmonized vocals that work really well with the longing feeling of the music and the lyrics and it really takes the listener on an emotional journey through the use of the music building up from quiet to a dramatic climax and fading back to calm. Two really great tracks from a band that recently released their first EP. These guys have massive potential and I’m excited to see how their debut LP comes out.
