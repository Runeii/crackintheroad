While I was unplugged from DAS INTERWEBZ last night, Odd Future leader Tyler, The Creator not only announced details regarding his new album, <em>Wolf</em>, but also dropped the video for the lead single from the album, ‘Domo 23’.</p>\n<p>The video continues where OFWGKTA’s [adult swim] show Loiter Squad left off and revolves around a wrestling match against Domo Genesis, with Earl Sweatshirt acting as the referee. If you’re not a fan of Odd Future’s aesthetic and sound, then ‘Domo 23’ is not going to change your opinion in the slightest, although I seriously doubt that’s what Tyler was aiming for. The video is irreverently amusing and appears to be a homage to, rather than a satire of, professional wrestling.The song itself is a typical Tyler affair; high energy, stabbing synths with the chromatic scales the group loves, shuffling drums and provocative lyrics delivered in Tyler’s trademark growl, all of which is highly enjoyable.</p>\n<p>The barsmith (this is going to be a ‘thing’ now) and beatmaker also released details regarding <em>Wolf. </em>Currently, the album is set to be dropped on the 2nd April and can be preordered on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wolf/id600946351\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a>. Probably my favourite thing about the announcement though are the three album covers Tyler has prepared for <em>Wolf</em>, which are shown below. The first of these actually gave me 4reel LULZ, which means that I need it on vinyl. Tyler also has a solitary UK show in London on the 30th March, with the venue TBA at the time of writing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/19803-newsvideo-tyler-the-creator-wolf-domo-23/attachment/tyler-wolf1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-19807\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-19807\" alt=\"tyler-wolf1\" src=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/02/tyler-wolf1-260x260.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19803-newsvideo-tyler-the-creator-wolf-domo-23/attachment/tyler_wolfcover1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-19806\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-19806\" alt=\"tyler_wolfcover1\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/02/tyler_wolfcover1-260x260.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19803-newsvideo-tyler-the-creator-wolf-domo-23/attachment/tyler-wolf-cover2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-19805\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-19805\" alt=\"tyler-wolf-cover2\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/02/tyler-wolf-cover2-260x260.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n","slug":"19803-newsvideo-tyler-the-creator-wolf-domo-23","category":"music","date":1360919956000,"wpid":19803,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":107,"src":"2013/02/img-tyler-the-creator-3_165009192402-165x107.jpeg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAIxAAAgECBQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBhEABQchMQQSEzJBUf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDLZrVumSWxzelcjijrlTkkL8EoQIlwz22lEgHa1xcflqi9YqXMIltCoewgdzRJIDD9lYruL874YYD/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587283950793,"updatedAt":1588443769615,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d11","old_image":"2013/02/img-tyler-the-creator-3_165009192402-165x107.jpeg","categories":["music","news","new","videos"]}
