As it turns out, a handful have managed to get in to the big wide world, one of which was found by Zane Lowe and promptly played on his Radio 1 show tonight, making this the one day his ‘hottest record in the world’ bullshit is actually true for once. Think about it, who <strong>doesn’t</strong> like Arcade Fire in the slightest? More importantly, if you know of someone, do they have a soul and are they sentient enough to be protected by human rights laws?</p>\n<p>First, the important part, links:</p>\n<p><strong>Download (slow, after all there are quite a lot of people wanting them. Not sure why)- </strong></p>\n<p>A:<a href=\"https://onethirtybpm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Arcade-Fire-The-Suburbs.mp3\">The Suburbs</a></p>\n<p>B: <a href=\"https://onethirtybpm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Arcade-Fire-Month-of-May1.mp3\">Month of May</a></p>\n<p><strong>Listen-</strong></p>\n<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mji0mxSXt8Q</p>\n<p>A: The Suburbs</p>\n<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23X24Ei7J2w</p>\n<p>B: Month of May</p>\n<p>Of the two, The Suburbs sounds more like a good album track (hopefully) than a lead single. Absoloutely nothing wrong with it at first listen, but perhaps a bit too plodding when it’s B Side is the tempo it is. Still, the track recalls the pre-Funeral work that made us all fall in love with the band the first time around, though it manages to do so without sounding like a backwards step.</p>\n<p>Month of May, meanwhile, sees Arcade Fire revive their rockier side, all that talk by Win of his love for Bruce Springsteen clearly wasn’t a lie. Of the two, this is the winner for me (after two listens though). I would write more on this, but you’re listening to it right now. You are aren’t you?</p>\n","slug":"990-arcade-fire-white-label-leaks","category":"music","date":1274893216000,"wpid":990,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":531,"height":493,"src":"2010/05/arcadefire-suburbs-month-of-may.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAJAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwQI/8QAJBAAAAUEAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAUABhEhEgcTMUE3crL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCm87idFnrvdzVxycXLx7lROMaJLimQpC47XFMNH56ER95rQVtPZd3bkU4kWZSPlmiSi5RHjhQSAJgx63nVGvU/5Xtj7J/oaZh80Wv/2Q=="},"createdAt":1587295240986,"updatedAt":1588403567339,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2010/05/arcadefire-suburbs-month-of-may.jpg","categories":["music"]}
