{"id":"5e9c0304774c2610387e4a7d","title":"New: Frida Sundemo – For You, Love","content":"<p>Its been five months since Frida Sundemo released her infectious and anthemic electronic-pop song, A Million Years, and I’ve been impatiently waiting ever since.</p><p> Today my wait has paid off and sees the release of a less aggressive and introspective track ‘For You, Love’–Not to be underestimated though. Sundemo proves again and again that she is a force equal in caliber to her fellow Swedes. For You, Love is the perfect example of airy synth pop with the faintest hint of saxophone floating in the background.  When we’re finally blessed with a full-length there’s very little doubt in my mind that Frida Sundemo will be a name on everyone’s tongue.</p>\n<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/110059042″ params=”color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>\n","slug":"25346-new-frida-sundemo-love","category":"new","date":1386694548000,"wpid":25346,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":950,"height":950,"src":"2013/12/1025394_10151496281988564_534497896_o-950x950.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgH/xAAhEAACAQQCAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAYREiEFMQcTMv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBh8i+WyCwyXGbfH7nx8VlLNu+Sd4w0i8lHEcu9aJ/Pe9U83GexrR9UDsYo5vuaWNJGWZyCwBINSZ3WVwrMAGIAB9UH/9k="},"createdAt":1587282692782,"updatedAt":1588443765617,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d20","old_image":"2013/12/1025394_10151496281988564_534497896_o-950x950.jpg","categories":["new"]}
