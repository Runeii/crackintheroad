{"id":"5e9c0726774c2610387e4f42","artists":["5e9b68f87a1236eccfeb2086"],"title":"Mixtape: Freekstile – Vigilante","content":"<p>One of my favourite mixtapes from the past couple of months was the collaboration between Freekstile & JoeyG, <a href=\"https://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/19954-mixtape-freekstile-joeyg-golden-house/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Golden House</em></a>. Something that caused the Brooklyn-based MC to stand-out on his last release was the manner in which he eschewed many common hip-hop themes and, instead, rapped about subjects that he holds dear. In Freekstile’s case, it happens to be video games and movies that occupy a fair amount of his attention.</p>\n<p>The beats that populate <em>Vigilante</em> are filled with ethereal synths bubbling between hi-hat heavy drums and, in general, are all skilfully put-together. At times, Freekstile sounds reminiscent of early Kanye West, minus the inflated sense of self-worth, and throughout <em>Vigilante</em> his rhymes remain consistent, if not earth-shattering.</p>\n<p>Highlights include: “Geeked Up (It’s All Good)’, ‘Tag Team’ and ‘Label’s Choice’.
