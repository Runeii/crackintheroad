At first glance he’s an artist riding the well ridden ‘chill-wave’. His synths are dreamy and ethereal, with the voice samples pitch tuned to create a ghost like atmosphere. Thankfully there’s so much more to<strong> Sun Glitters</strong>, his production is expertly crafted to form something that has a remarkable density. The voices whisper, giggle and mutter over the wonky hip-hip infused beats, in a way that simply isn’t present in most beat music today. The result is something genuinely enchanting.</p>\n<p><em>Check out his Everything Could be Fine EP bellow.</em></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1267719536/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://sunglitters.bandcamp.com/album/everything-could-be-fine\">everything could be fine by Sun Glitters</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"6317-introducing-sun-glitters","category":"music","date":1301940689000,"wpid":6317,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":188,"height":188,"src":"2011/04/sunglitters-188x188.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwb/xAAlEAABAgUCBwEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgQAAwUSMREhBgcTFDJCkaH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBf/EABsRAAEEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMhERIx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCq4vYt3dKkVJiroOW8sKCphsExI9gDtrBcazUiSRUmSQcApx+Qjc1pi+0oCb1WrphuGuyvHMBoUdMn7BwLs3KlN3ao/9k="},"createdAt":1587294543880,"updatedAt":1588443779114,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d24","old_image":"2011/04/sunglitters-188x188.jpg","categories":["music"]}
