Combining the kind of whining, grainy drones that formed the title track of Liars’ surprise change of direction <em>WIXIW, </em>with carefully constructed tenorion bloops, the sounds on <em>Pyramid </em>seem forever on the verge of drifting apart.</p>\n<p>It’s surprising then that <em>Pyramid </em>manages to use these to explore a variety of possibilities and ideas. Just take the naïvely romantic chimes of ‘Hibernation’, and compare them to the surprisingly organic drones and whirs of ‘Rotary Engine’, or just-shy-of-danceable organs on ‘M9’. Listening to the record from start to finish is akin to dipping in and out of a number of different nighttime soundscapes, each connected in spirit but offering a different experience.</p>\n<p>Oh and their Bandcamp page takes the whole obscurity trend to new heights, putting black text on a black background in a way that hides that fact you can actually download the EP.</p>\n<p>Bet that was intentional.</p>\n<p><em>Kids these days.</em></p>\n<p>[bandcamp width=350 height=725 album=2309229336 size=large bgcol=ffffff linkcol=63b2cc]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n","slug":"24094-introducing-monolth","category":"introducing","date":1378208521000,"wpid":24094,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2013/09/a2221672002_10-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAI/8QAIBAAAgAGAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxESITEEIhNhof/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDNaKERVVeormu/cGaRLuPWmdX6+RcZm8KZOLqZ1qBEkkkmpMB//9k="},"createdAt":1587283023277,"updatedAt":1588443767345,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0b","old_image":"2013/09/a2221672002_10-165x165.jpg","categories":["introducing","music"]}
