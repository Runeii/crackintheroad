Their hugely accomplished debut album of demos, titled <strong><em>Beacons</em></strong>, MNTT, marshalled by lead singer and chief songwriter, <strong>Brady Heyen</strong>, marks them out as one of the most exciting prospects in indie music. From stunning instrumental interludes (Burial, Mosamor) to epic moments of <strong>Arcade Fire</strong> inspired euphoria (Flood, Joy, Man From Illinois), it’s bold, hard-hitting, and above all, hugely enjoyable.
