This is partially down to a fairly noticeable proportion of acts based in the capital favouring appearance and concept over pure songwriting ability. What was once such an exciting part of the country, has become overrun with jaded hipster outfits and off-puttingly pretentious scene kids.</p>\n<p>One such act whom are attempting to change this preconception are Hackney duo <strong>Memory Maze</strong>. Their debut three tracks are no frills attached soft-rock, proving that no tricks are needed, just a more than adequate songwriting ability. <em>Modern Spring</em> is a reverb heavy post-rock inspired number, switching between epic choruses and introspective verses, providing a refreshingly invigorating sound. There’s a faint shoegaze influence that shines through, whilst another of the tracks, entitled <em>The Spark</em> begins somberly honest, allowing the vocals to gently usher the song on it’s way, before opening out into an epic, otherworldly climax. Check out the three debut tracks from <strong>Memory Maze</strong> below, and for those of you in London, be sure to head along to The Victoria on 23 November.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2665590142/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://memorymaze.bandcamp.com/track/the-spark\">The Spark by Memory Maze</a></iframe><br />\n<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3993571746/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://memorymaze.bandcamp.com/track/modern-spring\">Modern Spring by Memory Maze</a></iframe><br />\n<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1740446842/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://memorymaze.bandcamp.com/track/irreversible\">Irreversible by Memory Maze</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"12299-introducing-memory-maze","category":"introducing","date":1320606347000,"wpid":12299,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293551605,"updatedAt":1588441787297,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27374f624598ffa2a44a47ed2be.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
