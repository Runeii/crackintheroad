What you do need to know is that Mizan hails from New York, and this affects her music to it’s very core essence. In a world that has seen the rise of BANKS and SZA, it could very well be this authentic and close connection to her native city that separates Mizan out from the competition.</p>\n","slug":"28106-new-mizan-thru","category":"introducing","date":1398622301000,"wpid":28106,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282172671,"updatedAt":1588441757885,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d0e","old_image":"generated/7f65c4cd1d9c40eec469e25182c5a049bb068bd1.jpg","categories":["introducing","new","music","newnews"]}
