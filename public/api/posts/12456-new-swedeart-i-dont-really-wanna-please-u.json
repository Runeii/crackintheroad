I first heard this guy collaborate with <strong>TOKiMONSTA</strong> and <strong>Lunice</strong> (with a little help from <strong>HudMo</strong>) for Red Bull Music Academy last summer on the track <em>Alpenglow</em>, which despite being a one-off, was certainly an addictive track.</p>\n<p>In this new one, he characteristically puts the vocals in the intro, but then uses the melody throughout, and uses quiet moments to great effect. The synths become ghostly, the sampling popping up as if <strong>Swede:art</strong> is merely scanning through talk radio channels. The haunting sitar appears mid-way and adds to the mysteriousness of it all. Can’t wait to hear more from this guy – his debut last year, <em>Emotional Colours</em>, is not something I’ve yet sunk my teeth into, but I think I might just treat myself. And so should you.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to I Don’t Really Wanna Please U below.</em></p>\n<p><center><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27327603&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27327603&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object></center></p>\n","slug":"12456-new-swedeart-i-dont-really-wanna-please-u","category":"music","date":1320960813000,"wpid":12456,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293508512,"updatedAt":1588441786781,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b27390db19e1c724ba177484aeaf.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
