This new track from<strong> Lee</strong> features little information, aside from being uploaded via a Youtube account taken from<strong> Lee’s</strong> tumblr, however the vocals are distinctly similar to those found on previous<strong> MONEY</strong> tracks, and the lethargic, drawled organ is ever present. Two images flicker every few seconds, changing between an angelic, Virgin Mary statue and an all grey dead screen, the kind you find when there’s a transmission failure or the like.</p>\n<p>There’s a melancholic, slightly disgruntled feel to<em> Paradise Is Hell</em>, a poetic number dealing with the looming dishonesty of capitalism and adolescent angst. The comparisons with <strong>MONEY</strong> are unavoidable however to pigeon hole them both under the same banner would be offensive, with <strong>KRAKEN</strong> showcasing a slightly more awkward, delicate side to <strong>Lee</strong>. Ultimately, it may be ever-so introvert, but boy is it beautiful.</p>\n<p><em>‘trains to infinity’</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2YRD-w0NvU\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15642-new-kraken-money-paradise-is-hell","category":"music","date":1331837568000,"wpid":15642,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292665277,"updatedAt":1588441780124,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/4839facdfd8964d70af3dfd5962b37d7771ed463.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
