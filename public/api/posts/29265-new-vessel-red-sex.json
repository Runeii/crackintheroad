It’s an altogether more visceral, in-your-face piece of music which wastes little time in assaulting sensibilities with its pounding four-on-the-floor and manipulations of a modulated synthesiser. The remaining minutes go on to detail and develop this sound into intelligent areas by way of astute pitching and a shrill-sounding breakdown about halfway through.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/159813448&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Though it’s obviously difficult to speculate what the direction an entire album will take on the basis of one taster track, Vessel does seem to be following through on his expressed intention to shift away from “archetypal electronic sounds” towards a result “that felt more organic, even if the sounds themselves weren’t inherently organic”. Reportedly using a variety of object-instruments like percussive sheets of metal, as well as building his own make-shift flutes from sawn-off bicycle parts, he is clearly one of the producers currently out there who is pushing at the edges of the form, which is always exciting to see. After the publication of <strong>Actress’</strong> brilliant record, <strong><em>Ghettoville</em></strong>, earlier in the year, it could feasibly have been expected that no other 2014 release of this nature would top Darren Cunningham’s leaden, sparse and almost formless soundscape; but this threatens to do just that. <em>Red Sex</em> is available to stream now and the album, <em><strong>Punish, Honey</strong></em>, is due to be released on 15th September by Tri Angle Records.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sSOW1w2zeyw\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"29265-new-vessel-red-sex","category":"music","date":1406290000000,"wpid":29265,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282024836,"updatedAt":1588441755624,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d4a","old_image":"generated/992f456214e3989ccff1f09fea95c164eb773001.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
