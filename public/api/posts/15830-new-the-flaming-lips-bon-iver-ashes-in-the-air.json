Far from any bog standard vinyl re-release, it’s a full-sized compilation album featuring guest appearances from artists all the way from <strong>Nick Cave</strong> to <strong>Ke$ha</strong> – and here we have the first look at one of the brand new tracks off that album. With a guest appearance from <strong>Bon Iver</strong>, this track is very much <strong>Justin Vernon</strong> adapting to the style of <strong>Coyne</strong> and co, rather than vice versa. It’s a seriously awesome little song that not only demonstrates that <strong>The Flaming Lips </strong>are (once again) progressing on from their <em>Embryonic</em> sound, but are also actually putting the effort in to releasing an genuinely well-made full album next month – which is something to get pretty damned excited about.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F41158629&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe> </p>\n","slug":"15830-new-the-flaming-lips-bon-iver-ashes-in-the-air","category":"music","date":1332889645000,"wpid":15830,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2011/07/img_7484-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwX/xAAmEAABAgQFBAMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgQAAxEhBQcSFHEiIzFCYYGx/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABv/EABoRAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAQREtH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIGXSWj9thmHSEkOps8lSlC1SKGh4v8AUNO2w+R2g2QdHTdIPi0BuXpKHTTQSmiAsUtRQSaHn5hqck7mbf3P7CCwGdwnWAexbSXtMM//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587292614354,"updatedAt":1588403540723,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d16","old_image":"2011/07/img_7484-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
