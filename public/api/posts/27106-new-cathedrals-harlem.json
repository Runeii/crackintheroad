Dreamy, synth pop, it put them on the radar of numerous blogs, and in turn labels. Their second release, <em>Harlem</em>, is bolder and dare I even say <em>heavier </em>admirably not simply reverting to replicating their debut track, but actively pushing on for a new, more confident sound, complete with guitar solo. If their first outing wasn’t enough to convince, there’s no doubting now that <strong>CATHEDRALS</strong> are the real deal.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135593826&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27106-new-cathedrals-harlem","category":"music","date":1393459794000,"wpid":27106,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":1000,"height":1000,"src":"2014/02/1957800_215114765352167_1851898563_o.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGCP/EACEQAAICAgEEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFEQASEyGRMUKh/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhP/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIC/DFFkloUo07yuQU7Z3rQI+T52T+cJXESMoY166786MD7HrmjrWKxzZCvM1CoZT9zCvV71xfPVrrNIqwRBQxAAQaHnhOmPkN//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587282370819,"updatedAt":1588403518239,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2014/02/1957800_215114765352167_1851898563_o.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
