With their sights set upon the release of their debut record Palace, at the end of this month, and several singles under their belts to date, their fan base is rapidly expanding. Surfacing continues in a similar Echo & The Bunnyment tinged vein, emotionally driven shoegaze, verging on the realms of being sonically transcendent.. A pounding drum beat opens the track, whilst crystal clear vocals guide the track through it’s murky quagmire. Not too far from the sound White Lies re-invented in 2009, however the lyrics are far deeper, and one truly believes Chapel Club have utmost confidence in their mystic darkness. Look out for Surfacing over the coming weeks, as well as their debut LP Palace, towards the end of January.</p>\n<p><script src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_11244048.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n","slug":"3941-new-chapel-club-surfacing","category":"music","date":1294246723000,"wpid":3941,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":399,"src":"2011/06/chapel-club-by-ben-rayner.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAHhAAAgIDAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEBRIhkbH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABgRAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAkED/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDCu8epDtw9DmyvtRShYzHKoQrfuxd3X7kaTn7LuzJreKsSQLU0PuMZT1TIVoOz/9k="},"createdAt":1587294832963,"updatedAt":1588403561669,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/chapel-club-by-ben-rayner.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
