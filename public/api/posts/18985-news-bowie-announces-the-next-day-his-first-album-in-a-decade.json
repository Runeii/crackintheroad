Today marks the glam rock troubadour’s 66th birthday and <em>The Next Day</em> will be the first new album in ten years.</p>\n<p>According to the announcement by Iso/Columbia records in the early hours of this morning, Bowie’s new album will be entitled The Next Day, available as a pre-order on iTunes with a wider release scheduled for March. It’ll be his 30th studio album of his long, colourful yet often elusive career.</p>\n<p>The single, Where Are We Now?, was written by Bowie, recorded in New York and produced Tony Visconti. The accompanying video directed by Tony Oursler recalls Bowie’s time living in Berlin. He is seen looking in on vintage footage of the vast industrial city and the auto repair shop beneath the apartment he lived.
