So it’s geekier, slightly forced and backed by the underlying feeling that it may not be entirely serious, yet somehow it sort of works in it’s own introvert way. The video is a twisted European insight into bling culture, with the paradox of middle class suburbia contrasted against the garish, abrasive image portrayed by <strong>D E N A</strong>. <em>Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools</em> huh? If you say so.
