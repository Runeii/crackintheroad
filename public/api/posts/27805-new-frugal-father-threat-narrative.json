Lead single <em>Threat To Narrative</em> is another odd-pop masterpiece, fusing the sort of lo-fi aesthetic beloved of Casiotone For The Painfully Alone, with the broader, more expansive sound of LCD Soundsystem. Slightly introvert, and tongue in cheek at times: “but you bought all of my love / on a $10 card minimum”, it’s a unique, and thrilling sound, that Welch really makes his own.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137879329&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=true\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"27805-new-frugal-father-threat-narrative","category":"music","date":1396915143000,"wpid":27805,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587282248878,"updatedAt":1588441759084,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"generated/ab67616d0000b273488afeaf45f58beb47470225.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
