Breaking down the stages of grief into five segments; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance. No doubt a passage we have all trodden at one stage or another in our lives, albeit to varying intensities. A valid and stimulating inspiration upon which to base an epic 14 minute mega-song? You betcha your bottom dollar it is.</p>\n<p>So with this in mind, Oxford based post-rock influenced out-fit<em> </em><strong>Spring Offensive</strong> took about writing a song to incorporate all these feelings and emotions. <em>The First Of Many Dreams About Monsters </em>is an invigorating, thrilling masterpiece, coming in at almost a quarter of an hour, encapsulating numerous thoughts and experiences. The honest and emotive journey you are taken on is lightly comparable to that of<em> Hospice</em> by <strong>The Antlers</strong>, which deals with similar thematic issues.</p>\n<p>Chilling in parts, both with the musical composition and the lyrical imagery, “<em>I won’t let him be flecked with my blood, and pretend it is his own</em>” is just one of the haunting lines. The track is such intimate and personal struggle that is seems pointless to go into any real detail; there are the heavier moments, in denial and anger, and the slower, more considered sections such as depression. Each listener will take their own perspective on this brilliant, moving adventure.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Check back later in the week for an interview with Spring Offensive!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/springoffensive\">Spring Offensive On Myspace</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://drop.io/dreamsaboutmonsters\">Download ‘The First Of Many Dreams About Monsters’ Free From Here!</a></p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" codebase=\"https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F4332187&show_comments=true&auto_play=false&color=004fff\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F4332187&show_comments=true&auto_play=false&color=004fff\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object> <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/springoffensive/the-first-of-many-dreams-about-monsters\">The First of Many Dreams About Monsters</a> by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/springoffensive\">springoffensive</a></span></p>\n<p><script src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_11244048.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n","slug":"2808-review-spring-offensive-the-first-of-many-dreams-about-monsters","category":"music","date":1283941775000,"wpid":2808,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":600,"height":400,"src":"2011/06/l_a3c3aad09a754d43b029cce5ba5fdace.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAHAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUH/8QAHxAAAgEEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFESEiIzFR/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwT/xAAYEQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDE//aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Aw/HZK4WzRzcyoYj4olPVgWJOx6Pzmpj5bbsWgjLb56ilKn54s7sQv//Z"},"createdAt":1587294986057,"updatedAt":1588403563929,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2011/06/l_a3c3aad09a754d43b029cce5ba5fdace.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
