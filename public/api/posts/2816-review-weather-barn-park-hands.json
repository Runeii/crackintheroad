The band have wasted no time in organising gigs throughout Scotland as well as the release of their first single, <em>Park Hands</em>, on the 18<sup>th</sup> September. This band reshuffling has, in the bands own words has allowed them to be ‘well on the way to fulfilling our potential’, this shows a more serious and ambitious side to the group which had already proven to be tenacious and hard-working. All of these attributes can only lead to success and after hearing the first single, they have the musical talent to back up their personal strengths.</p>\n<p>The title song, <em>Park Hands</em>, juxtaposes aspects of rock and country to create a song that will one second cause you to tap your foot gently to the soft, comforting sounds then out of nowhere comes a heavier guitar melody and vocals which forces you to use your knees as a drum-kit and chant ‘there are monsters in this world, don’t be letting them scare you’. <em>Park Hands</em> is the most addictive and catchy song I have heard this year, with all aspects of the song coming together to create something that will appeal to all musical palettes.</p>\n<p>The other two songs on this CD are equally as impressive, but nevertheless entirely different. <em>Cinnamon Hill </em>is substantially more rock orientated, with a chorus that will repeat in your head long after the song concludes. The last song, <em>Each Side of Satan</em>, emphasises the bands interest in American bands such as <strong>Band of Horses </strong>and <strong>Death Cab for Cutie</strong> with very relaxed and colloquial style which contrasts perfectly with the other two songs.</p>\n<p>Overall, <em>Park Hands </em>is a début that deserves the recognition this band yearn to achieve, and with enough support and promotion <strong>Weather Barn </strong>have the ability, the drive and the passion that is required to permeate the UK market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/weatherbarn\">Check out their Myspace!</a></p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://video.unrulymedia.com/wildfire_11244048.js\"></script></p>\n","slug":"2816-review-weather-barn-park-hands","category":"music","date":1283858703000,"wpid":2816,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":500,"height":500,"src":"2010/09/park_hands.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, 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"},"createdAt":1587294995874,"updatedAt":1588403563984,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d07","old_image":"2010/09/park_hands.jpg","categories":["music","reviews"]}
