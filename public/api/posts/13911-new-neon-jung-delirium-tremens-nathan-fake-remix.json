All projects I’ve mentioned are worth checking out if you haven’t already.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <strong>Lone</strong> mentioned a release of both his next album (entitled <em>Galaxy Garden</em>) and <strong>Neon Jung</strong>‘s next single, featuring a remix from <strong>James Holden</strong>‘s<strong> Border Community</strong> regular <strong>Nathan Fake</strong>. I assume the single’s coming soon because the remix has just been posted by Fake, and it’s brilliant – a long one, usual for the Norfolk producer, but also returning to previous greatness (2009’s <em>Hard Islands</em> was his career highlight so far), and leapfrogging off last years <strong>Radiohead</strong> remix success. Plenty of ambience and a solid techno beat makes this one another surefire winner. It just needs to be heard to be believed…</p>\n<p><em>Enjoy Nathan Fake’s remix of Delirium Tremens below</em>. <em>The single is out mid-February on 12″ via Magic Wire Recordings.</em></p>\n<p><center><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33568605&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33568605&show_comments=false&auto_play=false&color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object></center></p>\n","slug":"13911-new-neon-jung-delirium-tremens-nathan-fake-remix","category":"music","date":1326747987000,"wpid":13911,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587293078515,"updatedAt":1588441783768,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"generated/97dd0362298f2cafbe7483c0ff3255d62c9b410e.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
