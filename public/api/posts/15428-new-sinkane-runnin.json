{"id":"5e9c2a389b6559241525d446","artists":["5e9b69447a1236eccfeb2526"],"title":"New: Sinkane – Runnin’","content":"<p>A nice soulful pop single from New York’s <strong>Sinkane</strong> was released today via his Bandcamp – and it’s a lovely little single at that.</p><p> The singer-songwriter has performed as a drummer for <strong>Of Montreal</strong>, <strong>Caribou</strong>, and most recently, <strong>Yeasayer</strong>. He’s new to the whole solo thing, but an album is imminent – from this track alone you can get an idea of the simple but expansive sound he’s going for.</p>\n<p>Not as campy as <strong>Yeasayer</strong>‘s recent output, I dare say, but still quite friendly. The best thing about this single is Dan Snaith, also known as the genius behind <strong>Caribou</strong>, under his electronic moniker <strong>Daphni</strong>, has done a drawn-out electrified remix. Similar to his edit of <strong>Orchestra Of Sphere</strong>‘s track last year, Snaith ‘goes lite’ on the track – modestly tossing it onto the dancefloor with not too much fuss and flair. I make it sound bad by saying that – if you know Snaith’s recent work, you’ll know how incredible it’s been (I don’t even need to mention <strong>Caribou</strong>‘s <em>Swim</em> and his <strong>Radiohead</strong> remix).</p>\n<p>Both the original of this track and the <strong>Daphni </strong>mix are both a nice surprise. You can download the EP for ‘name your price’ over at Bandcamp below. Be sure to keep an eye out for <strong>Sinkane</strong>‘s debut album, and whatever <strong>Daphni</strong> has next up his sleeve!</p>\n<p><em>Hear and/or download Runnin’ below, with remixes by Daphni and Chandeliers.</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"410\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 410px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3787264846/size=grande3/bgcol=f7ffef/linkcol=000000/transparent=true/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"https://sinkane.bandcamp.com/album/runnin\">Runnin’ by SINKANE</a></iframe></p>\n","slug":"15428-new-sinkane-runnin","category":"music","date":1330623310000,"wpid":15428,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":{"width":165,"height":165,"src":"2012/03/422331_10150570603733440_17533178439_9045891_1287531888_n-165x165.jpg","placeholder":"data:image/jpeg;base64, /9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAKAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwX/xAAjEAACAgIABQUAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEABEFByExQQYTIiMy/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABf/EABkRAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAEQf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Auc0OIGKAWK1h4rVZ915IrLoU11AKD4kHXkHe9YlUrlaenBNNoSyRq7hewJGzrADmdI6+puFBXYBng2Ae/wBgxRlY+6/U/o+cCpMFVx7dtFAI93//2Q=="},"createdAt":1587292728383,"updatedAt":1588443775440,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d10","old_image":"2012/03/422331_10150570603733440_17533178439_9045891_1287531888_n-165x165.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
