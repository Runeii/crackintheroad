Below is a gallery of the fantastic <strong>MadeScapes ^</strong> and their visceral multimedia installations, with Soundcloud links the killer artists we’ve booked this month.</p>\n<p>See you there!</p>\n<p>8-LATE<br />\n£5</p>\n<p><strong>BUSSEY BUILDING: PECKHAM</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/525433147500120/\">EVENT RSVP</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>MadeScapes ^</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/music/20514-announcement-citr-live-001-jamie-isaac-iyes-azakel-kirk-spencer-visuals-by-madescapes/attachment/45079_10151131420116561_1981764929_n/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-20522\"><img class=\" wp-image-20522 alignnone\" src=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uploads/2013/03/45079_10151131420116561_1981764929_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/03/45079_10151131420116561_1981764929_n.jpg 720w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/03/45079_10151131420116561_1981764929_n-300x200.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/03/45079_10151131420116561_1981764929_n-50x33.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <a href=\"https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20514-announcement-citr-live-001-jamie-isaac-iyes-azakel-kirk-spencer-visuals-by-madescapes/attachment/madescapes3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-20520\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-20520\" src=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/03/MADESCAPES3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/03/MADESCAPES3.jpg 960w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/03/MADESCAPES3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://api.crackintheroad.com/images/2013/03/MADESCAPES3-50x33.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Jamie Isaac</strong></p>\n<p>With his first EP due out in May, this is surely the year that Jamie Isaac surges into the eyes and ears of just about everyone. Delicately arranged yet vast and brooding in its scope, Jamie has a very special sound on his hands; he’ll be playing the entire new EP at our first show.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F42007216\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>IYES</strong></p>\n<p>Brighton’s <strong>IYES’</strong>s came out of nowhere when they dropped their ridiculously buss-worthy debut track <em>Lighthouse.</em> A track that inspired me to write this, <em>“Sure they want you to think about loss, that special someone that got away, but they also want to place you in a nightclub at 3am, gormlessly staring into a strobe light, wondering how the fuck you’re going to bounce back from it all.” </em>It also made me shout at my computer a lot, i do that when i like music.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F79494208\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>(UPDATE) MOKO<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UW6U7-396XA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Kirk Spencer</strong></p>\n<p>With his second EP just dropped, Kirk Spencer is playing his first London date for a little while now to promo the record.
