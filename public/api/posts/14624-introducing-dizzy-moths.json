This is all relevant, because my instinct tells me that nine months from now, I’ll be recounting a similar story about <strong>Dizzy Moths</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I’m in a far healthier mental state than before, but his luxurious, bedroom pop has had a similar impact, planting itself deeply in my consciousness. With (what I assume is) his debut release, the six track<em><strong> Bed Bugs & Haunts</strong></em>, <strong>Dizzy Moths</strong> displays more personality than most artists do in their entire career. Take<em> Go Gods</em>, a track that’s beauty escapes my limited descriptive vocabulary, and quite comfortably the finest track I’ve heard thus far in 2012. As a release, it packs an emotional punch, flirting between fragile vulnerability and expansive magnificence. To put it simply,<strong> Dizzy Moths</strong> has left me lost for words.</p>\n<p>Check out my choice picks below, <em>Go Gods</em> and <em>Rome</em>, and head over to the <strong>Dizzy Moths</strong> <a href=\"https://dizzymoths.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> to stream the entire release.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2400685381/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4270396699/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"14624-introducing-dizzy-moths","category":"introducing","date":1328545453000,"wpid":14624,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587292939860,"updatedAt":1587825903907,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","categories":["introducing","new","music"]}
