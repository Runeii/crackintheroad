Arguably more confident and reassured than previous outings, it’s an extremely exciting first taster of their long awaited debut album, <em><strong>Chants For Friends</strong></em>, expected later this year / start of next year.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F105286173\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n","slug":"23912-new-lets-buy-happiness-run","category":"music","date":1376702333000,"wpid":23912,"isSticky":false,"featured_image":null,"createdAt":1587283066018,"updatedAt":1588441763353,"author":"5e9b68b27a1236eccfeb1d27","old_image":"2013/08/tumblr_mrl5h1w8hy1qe69zeo1_1280-950x633.jpg","categories":["music","new"]}
